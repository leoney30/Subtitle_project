1
00:00:07,403 --> 00:00:11,700
Right lads, to say I'm excited for this one is a little bit of an understatement, isn't it Tom?

2
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,693
Yeah, I think this is the first podcast you've ever done preparation for.

3
00:00:14,753 --> 00:00:16,220
I've done some proper preparation.

4
00:00:16,662 --> 00:00:17,626
It's going to be incredible.

5
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:18,450
It's going to be incredible.

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,997
Cutler, we are going to start with you

7
00:00:20,117 --> 00:00:22,181
even though we've got Emi next, we're going to start with you, all right?

8
00:00:22,221 --> 00:00:23,603
Because I want to know...

9
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:26,268
what your first impressions of Emi were.

10
00:00:26,308 --> 00:00:27,631
I want to know why you signed him.

11
00:00:27,711 --> 00:00:29,294
I want to know all the details, mate.

12
00:00:29,614 --> 00:00:34,619
Yeah, it all started off when we knew we needed a new goalie.

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,067
So you're at Aston Villa, you're at Aston Villa at this point.

14
00:00:37,087 --> 00:00:38,212
Yeah, new goalie, had injuries.

15
00:00:38,974 --> 00:00:44,242
I think Tom Heaton had done his knee at the time that he did his ACL, struggling with injuries, and we knew we had to bring one in.

16
00:00:44,963 --> 00:00:46,427
And I've got a specific style.

17
00:00:46,467 --> 00:00:49,534
I've got a specific... Set of skills?

18
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:52,762
And I will kill you.

19
00:00:54,567 --> 00:00:55,478
Yeah, just...

20
00:00:55,913 --> 00:00:59,966
the way I want a goalkeeper to move, the biomechanics of a goalie, the way he plays, the way he moves.

21
00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:03,158
a philosophy that I stick to that I think works.

22
00:01:04,221 --> 00:01:06,245
I've seen Emi play quite a few times for Arsenal.

23
00:01:06,265 --> 00:01:09,190
I'm like, I can make him even better.

24
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,532
Like you see something and you think,

25
00:01:11,294 --> 00:01:16,929
Just fit the way I that I work perfectly like his handshape in relation to the ball very very

26
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:20,811
limited triggers, the way he transfers, the way he gets onto his leading leg,

27
00:01:20,811 --> 00:01:23,380
 the way he pushes, his athleticism, power, speed around the goal.

28
00:01:23,981 --> 00:01:25,024
all suited the way I work.

29
00:01:25,104 --> 00:01:28,876
And then when we were at Villa, we needed to beat West Ham away.

30
00:01:29,457 --> 00:01:31,862
And you were at Watford and you were playing each other at that last game.

31
00:01:31,903 --> 00:01:33,566
And Watford needed to beat Arsenal.

32
00:01:35,431 --> 00:01:41,629
And we watched the game and he made a save against Troy Deeney where his hand shapes in relation to ball distance were perfect. Perfect. 

33
00:01:41,951 --> 00:01:46,727
Cut back, ball got, I think Deeney must have hit it from about six, seven yards and you spun.

34
00:01:47,048 --> 00:01:48,211
and your handshakes are perfect."

35
00:01:48,231 --> 00:01:49,675
And I'm like, that is the boy.

36
00:01:49,715 --> 00:01:50,165
That's the guy.

37
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:53,701
at this point, so this is your ninth game of the season.

38
00:01:53,741 --> 00:01:56,824
So you've been sat on the bench all season long, Bernt Leno's playing,

39
00:01:57,304 --> 00:02:02,024
and you get in for the last nine games of the season and it's fair to say he ripped it up didn't he for them nine games

40
00:02:02,024 --> 00:02:03,473
Yeah.

41
00:02:04,822 --> 00:02:05,526
So, yes, that's a

42
00:02:05,928 --> 00:02:11,722
Just seeing the way that he played in those nine games just suited me and my philosophy down to the ground.

43
00:02:12,805 --> 00:02:16,665
It was a matter of then doing presentations to the club, obviously going to Dean Smith,

44
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,931
and the powers that be above to then say, look, this is the guy.

45
00:02:21,591 --> 00:02:25,097
showing him clips, sitting down, why he's the guy, why he would suit us.

46
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,143
Then it was just a matter of speaking.

47
00:02:28,203 --> 00:02:30,588
We spoke on the phone a few times, didn't we?

48
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:32,753
Once I spoke to him, then you get that...

49
00:02:33,877 --> 00:02:37,007
if anybody that's met him, that unbelievable drive to improve like that.

50
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,115
That's like, this is where I want to be.

51
00:02:39,176 --> 00:02:40,983
This is where I'm going to get to.

52
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:41,926
And you're like, oh, okay.

53
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,170
I like that.

54
00:02:43,491 --> 00:02:46,381
I want to be the number one at Aston Villa.

55
00:02:46,521 --> 00:02:47,865
I want to get in the Argentinian team.

56
00:02:48,187 --> 00:02:49,753
and I want to get to this, this, this, and this.

57
00:02:49,813 --> 00:02:51,520
And you're like, yeah, I can help that.

58
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,142
I can do that.

59
00:02:52,163 --> 00:02:52,644
Do you know, like...

60
00:02:53,768 --> 00:02:54,752
Somebody's pushing you now.

61
00:02:54,772 --> 00:02:56,497
Somebody going, I want you to get me here.

62
00:02:56,537 --> 00:02:57,159
I want to be here.

63
00:02:57,601 --> 00:02:59,126
And that's just how it started.

64
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:03,440
And then when you got him onto the training pitch, was he everything you had seen, everything you had wanted?

65
00:03:03,982 --> 00:03:06,232
Yeah, I mean, there was a lot of work that went into getting him.

66
00:03:06,332 --> 00:03:07,095
He was a wanted man.

67
00:03:07,376 --> 00:03:09,084
Like, he had to sit down with his agents,

68
00:03:09,545 --> 00:03:14,290
presentations, a lot of phone calls, what I could do for him, how I felt I could help him.

69
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:19,876
And I think we struck off a really close relationship really early, you know, like we could sense like,

70
00:03:20,738 --> 00:03:23,751
We're both so passionate about goalkeeping and passionate about getting...

71
00:03:25,218 --> 00:03:29,595
Not only does he know that I want to improve him, but I want to get better.

72
00:03:29,855 --> 00:03:30,818
I want to keep improving.

73
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:33,625
I want to be the best goalie coached and he wants to be the best goalie.

74
00:03:34,327 --> 00:03:39,508
kind of constantly pushing each other to improve and to see that from the very, very start that we were going to do that.

75
00:03:39,649 --> 00:03:42,823
And so was the goalie coach a genuine...

76
00:03:43,968 --> 00:03:44,449
It mattered.

77
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,717
It really mattered who the goalie coach was about.

78
00:03:46,737 --> 00:03:47,921
Don't get me wrong, you've got to be joining

79
00:03:48,443 --> 00:03:51,211
a good sized football club, a club that befits your skills.

80
00:03:51,572 --> 00:03:54,100
But is that a genuine consideration for you?

81
00:03:54,141 --> 00:03:55,164
Just who that guy is?

82
00:03:55,324 --> 00:04:02,121
well yeah yeah it does firstly first you see the club who obviously is interested in you and

83
00:04:02,662 --> 00:04:07,809
then you see the coach and you see the team and then obviously then you see the goalie coach but for me I

84
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:13,368
the team it was more important you know the club you know it wasn't just the goalie coach but i knew

85
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:17,218
that if he's a goalie coach that obviously they know

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,627
I obviously, I spoke with my agent who's a goalie coach.

87
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:23,358
I didn't really know Cutler  before 

88
00:04:23,358 --> 00:04:27,864
and everything is put really highly as Paul, you know, Sal Bebo, what do you think of new catalyst?

89
00:04:27,884 --> 00:04:29,207
You know, as a top man,

90
00:04:29,207 --> 00:04:30,069
It's going to improve you.

91
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,334
And that gives you that little help.

92
00:04:32,354 --> 00:04:33,516
He was pushing me on the phone.

93
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:36,970
you know texting me also every time

94
00:04:39,996 --> 00:04:43,821
I went to Aston Villa to earn five, six grand less a week.

95
00:04:44,053 --> 00:04:44,662
Really?

96
00:04:44,662 --> 00:04:50,279
Yeah, but it wasn't for me the drive for the money, which is the drive of improving it and

97
00:04:50,721 --> 00:04:51,824
And he was a man, honestly.

98
00:04:52,385 --> 00:04:53,268
He was one of the main reasons.

99
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:59,005
always had that faith then have you always had that faith in your ability because like you say you you're taking a wage cut

100
00:04:59,346 --> 00:05:00,328
to come to Aston Villa.

101
00:05:00,888 --> 00:05:05,175
A lot of people will see it as a step down, but did you see it as almost like a step forward to then

102
00:05:05,535 --> 00:05:07,159
go and show everybody what you can do.

103
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,903
So you can get into the Argentina squad.

104
00:05:08,924 --> 00:05:10,507
You can play at the Copa America.

105
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,450
You can play in World Cups.

106
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,272
Is that how you saw it?

107
00:05:12,673 --> 00:05:17,694
Yeah, I wanted to not to be the main man, but just to play every game.

108
00:05:17,975 --> 00:05:19,540
you know, and improve every game.

109
00:05:19,761 --> 00:05:23,453
At four, I had everything to succeed, you know, how they...

110
00:05:24,596 --> 00:05:30,669
the right family, the right agents, you know, I'm always fit, you know, I eat well, I train as

111
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,072
as hard as I can.

112
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:35,637
He knows that I like to dive, I like to train, I like to push.

113
00:05:36,198 --> 00:05:39,183
I push myself as much as I push him or I push the club.

114
00:05:40,727 --> 00:05:43,838
Sometimes from the outside they see someone that I'm not.

115
00:05:44,095 --> 00:05:46,583
I'm just always trying to help everybody.

116
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:51,047
Even nowadays, you see after the World Cup, I just keep trying to improve.

117
00:05:53,217 --> 00:05:54,743
I think I made the right call at the time.

118
00:05:55,546 --> 00:05:58,251
We also had targets at the start of the season, didn't we?

119
00:05:58,271 --> 00:05:59,254
For the very first season.

120
00:05:59,775 --> 00:06:05,876
targets on his locker and I knew as soon as he opened his door to his locker every day he would see those targets and know exactly

121
00:06:06,057 --> 00:06:11,195
type of person he is he'd be like I'm doing that and I'm doing that and I'm doing that and he smashed every single one

122
00:06:11,697 --> 00:06:17,651
like regular, obviously first team player for Aston Villa every week, played every week, Copa America.

123
00:06:19,198 --> 00:06:21,932
clean sheets, passing percentage, cross percentage.

124
00:06:22,474 --> 00:06:25,987
All the stats were right up there and smashed every single one in his first season.

125
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,677
And then it's obviously just built on from there.

126
00:06:30,587 --> 00:06:31,330
I'm all over this.

127
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,835
I just want to let you two keep talking on this.

128
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:37,411
Is stats then something that's massive for you?

129
00:06:37,532 --> 00:06:40,338
So I can imagine after games that you are

130
00:06:40,558 --> 00:06:47,986
like you're pouring through everything on a Monday morning you'll be looking at the game you'll be looking at your touches and you'll be breaking everything down to the minutest detail  

131
00:06:48,687 --> 00:06:53,831
not everything you know Harvey's is something like similar to to cats.

132
00:06:53,831 --> 00:07:00,078
He loves stats, you know, so do I, but I don't just follow set percentage or how many catches I got.

133
00:07:00,499 --> 00:07:02,812
It's about how I manage a game as well.

134
00:07:03,395 --> 00:07:04,220
Let's say we're winning

135
00:07:04,863 --> 00:07:06,549
It was 3-3 against Liverpool the other day.

136
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,684
I made a huge mistake early on and I was so happy to get a draw and control the game.

137
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,092
I would say, no, I need to win the game, I need to win the game.

138
00:07:14,656 --> 00:07:20,410
Yes, obviously this season is one of the best seasons for the club in 42 years.

139
00:07:21,834 --> 00:07:23,057
But I kept only eight clean sheets.

140
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:27,087
Even my war season for Villa, I kept 11.

141
00:07:28,751 --> 00:07:29,853
And then he showed me the stats.

142
00:07:29,893 --> 00:07:33,301
He said, it's the season with most goals prevented in the league that I ever had.

143
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:39,033
since I joined England, since I signed for Arsenal.

144
00:07:39,913 --> 00:07:43,689
it's like i am achieving something really good even this season that but

145
00:07:44,171 --> 00:07:47,242
I want 10 clean sheets, my locker is minimum 10 clean sheets, 11.

146
00:07:48,326 --> 00:07:50,897
So I was fuming, I couldn't get it.

147
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:54,382
You mentioned the mistake the other night against Liverpool.

148
00:07:56,044 --> 00:07:59,573
There's a lot of goalkeepers I know and a lot of goalkeepers I will see on the TV.

149
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:01,638
If they make a mistake like that, they know it's on Sky.

150
00:08:01,678 --> 00:08:02,741
They know it's a big game.

151
00:08:03,904 --> 00:08:05,149
How did you deal with that?

152
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:06,293
How did you cope with that?

153
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:08,742
Did you feel like you could easily just park it

154
00:08:08,962 --> 00:08:10,367
and move on with the rest of the game?

155
00:08:10,387 --> 00:08:12,815
Because it was, we're talking first, second minute of the game, aren't we?

156
00:08:13,236 --> 00:08:18,308
60 seconds yeah i watched the clock 60 seconds uh you know it was funny because

157
00:08:19,312 --> 00:08:22,688
Obviously, I was reading the cross already and then Pau deflects it, so...

158
00:08:23,592 --> 00:08:27,668
my mistake was not to push in it was trying to catch it I'm also

159
00:08:27,989 --> 00:08:29,736
I was so comfortable, so confident to catch it.

160
00:08:29,756 --> 00:08:30,620
Too eager to get the next one.

161
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,447
And it was really, you know, I have new gloves.

162
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,158
And it was quite slippery.

163
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:36,625
I was trying to get some grip on it.

164
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,911
And obviously I tried to catch it without you.

165
00:08:39,931 --> 00:08:42,553
Just push it back into the into power.

166
00:08:42,553 --> 00:08:42,556
Just out there somewhere.

167
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:43,553
Just out there somewhere.

168
00:08:43,553 --> 00:08:44,228
Yeah.

169
00:08:44,641 --> 00:08:48,119
But then I turn and the ref look at me saying, no, I can't help you.

170
00:08:50,746 --> 00:08:53,993
the red look on me saying oh mate sorry I can't help it

171
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,883
Were you looking at the referees yesterday?

172
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,805
That can't be a goal.

173
00:08:58,469 --> 00:09:00,072
It's only 60 seconds.

174
00:09:00,131 --> 00:09:06,274
that can't be a goal mate because I prepared myself so bad even my psychology this is the game I need to perform this is the

175
00:09:06,495 --> 00:09:08,764
This is myself, you know, I miss last...

176
00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:13,117
Second half of Chelsea and Brighton and I said, I need to help the team.

177
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:14,300
I need to kill the season.

178
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,683
You know, I had a really good season.

179
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,257
I need to kill it this game. 60 seconds  

180
00:09:17,886 --> 00:09:20,704
I made probably one of my worst mistakes since I joined the club

181
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,953
And what about after the game, Emi?

182
00:09:23,013 --> 00:09:24,595
How do you deal with that?

183
00:09:24,635 --> 00:09:25,536
Do you just kind of say,

184
00:09:25,936 --> 00:09:31,069
it's done i've done the best i can and move on or do you kind of dissect it that night or wait till

185
00:09:31,851 --> 00:09:33,093
a couple of days later in training.

186
00:09:33,374 --> 00:09:34,136
How do you deal with those?

187
00:09:34,336 --> 00:09:35,158
No, I...

188
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:40,334
I was fuming with my centre-back because I think the following pass he went forward.

189
00:09:40,374 --> 00:09:41,457
I said, no, no.

190
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:42,120
Give me the ball back.

191
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:43,164
Give me the ball.

192
00:09:43,425 --> 00:09:45,513
It's not like it affects me at all.

193
00:09:45,955 --> 00:09:46,677
Before maybe...

194
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,425
you will think, okay, you know, I was thinking about it, but I was like, now give me the ball, give me the ball.

195
00:09:51,445 --> 00:09:53,026
You know, I was, I catch a cross.

196
00:09:53,087 --> 00:09:53,107
I,

197
00:09:54,068 --> 00:09:55,489
It did not affect me one bit.

198
00:09:55,609 --> 00:09:56,691
So I went after the game.

199
00:09:56,731 --> 00:10:00,095
I said to my psychologist, I'm a better goalkeeper today.

200
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,378
You know, I am because I feel so good.

201
00:10:02,438 --> 00:10:03,719
I made five, six saves.

202
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,981
I still win.

203
00:10:05,476 --> 00:10:07,004
I remember after two minutes,

204
00:10:07,244 --> 00:10:11,917
I went for, it was a long ball and I jumped outside the box and I hit the wire and I'm like, nothing happened.

205
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,642
And that keeps improving me.

206
00:10:14,722 --> 00:10:18,609
I know I'm 31, but I believe that I'm not on my peak yet.

207
00:10:19,492 --> 00:10:21,320
How long have you been working with a psychologist for?

208
00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:28,856
after hit office or must be like six years with the same and how much has that helped your game defensive

209
00:10:29,357 --> 00:10:35,992
Massive because you know when I'm too high when I won the yashi in the FIFA base I won the best goalie award in the World Cup

210
00:10:36,012 --> 00:10:39,243
I was like, I'm the best.

211
00:10:39,383 --> 00:10:42,353
And he always brings you down when you're too high and he never...

212
00:10:43,116 --> 00:10:45,423
I'm never too low when I make a mistake.

213
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:46,887
So it's huge.

214
00:10:46,968 --> 00:10:47,610
I'm always that...

215
00:10:47,982 --> 00:10:49,220
7，8，7，8 

216
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:54,160
you would never see me attend and I'm not to you know so for me consistency

217
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,385
for goalies is one of the hardest things.

218
00:10:56,626 --> 00:10:58,811
I always found that you were most annoyed

219
00:10:59,754 --> 00:11:02,043
when there was a shot that you really couldn't save.

220
00:11:02,485 --> 00:11:04,594
So we went through a season of probably

221
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:08,288
seven, eight, nine, 10 deflections, like ridiculous.

222
00:11:08,975 --> 00:11:10,561
But he'd come in going, I've got to save it.

223
00:11:10,922 --> 00:11:13,250
And you're going, mate, it might be difficult to save that.

224
00:11:13,331 --> 00:11:14,716
No, no, no, I've got to save it.

225
00:11:15,077 --> 00:11:20,266
So he spends so many hours on holding his shape for longer and transferring later. 

226
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:21,527
We bought a deflection net.

227
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:22,327
Deflection net.

228
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:24,109
You're going to have to stand up for longer then.

229
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:25,630
You're going to have to see it for longer.

230
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:29,275
not go down too early and hold on smashing things at rebound next.

231
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:32,240
So just because there's so many deflections, I've got to save it.

232
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,042
Well, I'll lose weight then.

233
00:11:36,148 --> 00:11:37,052
Calm down, mate.

234
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:37,956
You can't save everything.

235
00:11:37,996 --> 00:11:38,860
No, I've got to save it.

236
00:11:39,422 --> 00:11:41,928
Okay, then we'll do this and we'll do this and we'll do this.

237
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:43,231
It wasn't the mistakes.

238
00:11:43,552 --> 00:11:44,575
It was more the ones that...

239
00:11:45,617 --> 00:11:47,019
that were probably unsavable.

240
00:11:47,319 --> 00:11:50,843
And Emi mentioned about being 31 and not hitting his prime, so Cuts, what's...

241
00:11:51,263 --> 00:11:56,593
What's your opinion on goalies and primes, ages?

242
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:00,859
I think it all depends on how many games you've played, how experienced you are.

243
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,241
You can have goalies that

244
00:12:04,203 --> 00:12:09,752
I've played really, really young, and they've played lots of games and lots of games, and I think you can beat...

245
00:12:10,634 --> 00:12:13,678
I can have like get to a peak quite early.

246
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:18,167
I wouldn't say a peak, but you can get to that experience and knowledge where you go into games and you're just like,

247
00:12:18,687 --> 00:12:19,888
So this is not a problem.

248
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,129
Yeah, he just goes, this is not a problem to me.

249
00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:21,890
I'll just cruise it.

250
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,011
And he can do that early.

251
00:12:23,051 --> 00:12:23,952
Like goalie's young.

252
00:12:24,613 --> 00:12:27,039
and have played a lot of games and just go, right, this is quite easy for me.

253
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,547
We can get goalies that are older, not played the games, who go into games and you're like,

254
00:12:30,948 --> 00:12:37,404
not quite sure it takes them a little bit longer so i think it's just different in personalities different personalities different ways of thinking

255
00:12:37,745 --> 00:12:41,712
like say psychologists are a big help, but I don't think you can gauge it.

256
00:12:41,732 --> 00:12:42,714
I don't think you can measure it.

257
00:12:42,854 --> 00:12:43,836
It all depends on the person.

258
00:12:44,077 --> 00:12:46,907
Yeah, what age do you think you were at your best? 

259
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:52,120
32, 33, 34, I'd say.

260
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,378
Is that when Cuts was your coach?

261
00:12:54,698 --> 00:12:55,099
Yeah, probably.

262
00:12:55,119 --> 00:12:56,001
It's not far off, actually.

263
00:12:56,021 --> 00:12:56,563
Thank you very much.

264
00:12:56,823 --> 00:12:57,964
Yeah, it's not far off.

265
00:12:58,705 --> 00:13:01,168
Yeah, I think I got to a point where I was just

266
00:13:01,409 --> 00:13:03,678
a lot more comfortable in my own skin as well.

267
00:13:03,939 --> 00:13:05,686
So when I got more comfortable in my own skin,

268
00:13:06,128 --> 00:13:09,140
I felt like I could go on the pitch and just, it is what it is.

269
00:13:10,304 --> 00:13:11,445
I remember thinking,

270
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:14,376
I always used to think, don't make a mistake, don't make a mistake.

271
00:13:14,637 --> 00:13:16,020
But then when I got to the point where I could say,

272
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:16,702
Do you know what?

273
00:13:16,742 --> 00:13:17,605
It's not the end of the world.

274
00:13:17,826 --> 00:13:18,407
It is what it is.

275
00:13:18,568 --> 00:13:19,692
I'm not trying to make a mistake.

276
00:13:19,712 --> 00:13:20,936
Just to get a point and not get three points.

277
00:13:20,936 --> 00:13:21,711
Exactly.

278
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,884
It just is what it is.

279
00:13:22,965 --> 00:13:24,290
So you get comfortable in your own skin.

280
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,937
Like you say, it's like that one where you can go out and go,

281
00:13:26,218 --> 00:13:31,011
what will be will be I'm just going to enjoy it I'm going to enjoy it the best I possibly can just do my best

282
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:32,713
 but that's my problem I can't enjoy it

283
00:13:33,234 --> 00:13:34,338
People say enjoy the game.

284
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:35,221
I say I can't enjoy it.

285
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:36,745
I enjoy it on my own way.

286
00:13:37,006 --> 00:13:37,387
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

287
00:13:37,628 --> 00:13:39,436
Because the manager said, oh, get the win.

288
00:13:39,898 --> 00:13:40,782
You need to enjoy it.

289
00:13:41,103 --> 00:13:41,824
I enjoy my way.

290
00:13:41,964 --> 00:13:47,112
When I go home with my kids, I'm so focused on getting the win or the draw.

291
00:13:47,512 --> 00:13:50,545
yeah that can't enjoy the game i'm so focused you know i

292
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:53,914
I remember Aaron saying they can't concentrate himself in games.

293
00:13:54,817 --> 00:13:58,312
he winds people up to get that fire going which is that helps him

294
00:13:59,076 --> 00:14:01,686
And I'm completely the opposite.

295
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:04,035
I'm concentrating 99 minutes.

296
00:14:05,119 --> 00:14:07,983
There's no one minute that can't concentrate so even if you're

297
00:14:08,544 --> 00:14:13,597
three nil up it's the 94th minute the moment i'm more concentrated because i want the clean sheet really

298
00:14:13,977 --> 00:14:17,160
Even when we're attacking, I'm screaming on my centre-back for rest defending.

299
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,921
You will hear me, rest defending?

300
00:14:19,742 --> 00:14:25,452
pow by screaming they would say leave me alone you know maybe that's you know

301
00:14:25,753 --> 00:14:31,306
If you look at Ramsdale, Rambo looks like he's getting more comfortable in the way he plays.

302
00:14:32,349 --> 00:14:33,933
he stepped up when he got the move to Arsenal.

303
00:14:33,953 --> 00:14:36,098
But I couldn't do that at the age of his age.

304
00:14:36,118 --> 00:14:36,259
Yeah.

305
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,921
So different people are different, aren't they?

306
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:41,486
Like different characters, different people and the way they go about the game and the way they,

307
00:14:42,067 --> 00:14:43,731
think about the game completely different.

308
00:14:43,811 --> 00:14:46,899
I think this is a really interesting point with you then, I mean, I think, because...

309
00:14:48,102 --> 00:14:51,990
I don't know if it's fair to say or not, but a late bloomer, that's what I would call you.

310
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,574
Do you know what that means in English?

311
00:14:54,275 --> 00:14:58,662
so you didn't really really start playing until 27 was it I think maybe 20

312
00:15:02,108 --> 00:15:05,643
25, 26, 27 until you actually start playing

313
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,223
Real?

314
00:15:06,304 --> 00:15:06,865
I did play.

315
00:15:07,327 --> 00:15:08,330
You were out alone a lot.

316
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:11,639
I went alone a lot and I played 18 games for Wolves

317
00:15:12,341 --> 00:15:13,903
14 games for Wednesday.

318
00:15:14,284 --> 00:15:14,925
A lot for Reading.

319
00:15:15,546 --> 00:15:20,985
for ready in 12 games for Roger and they call me to stay up in the league and I didn't relegate you know what I

320
00:15:21,447 --> 00:15:23,171
You know, for me, those were victories.

321
00:15:23,551 --> 00:15:24,814
And I learned along the way.

322
00:15:24,834 --> 00:15:28,291
You know, I went to Oxford for one game, League Two, at the age of 18.

323
00:15:28,663 --> 00:15:30,827
So in every loan that I've been,

324
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:32,673
It's been successful.

325
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,747
And the only one I didn't play well is Getafe because they didn't play me.

326
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:36,993
That was in Spain.

327
00:15:37,073 --> 00:15:38,861
That was the lowest point in my career.

328
00:15:39,664 --> 00:15:43,350
When I went to Rotterdam, I remember that season I played Champions League for Arsenal.

329
00:15:43,931 --> 00:15:45,274
Played, I think, nine games.

330
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:46,656
Played West Brom against you.

331
00:15:46,937 --> 00:15:47,839
Kept a clean sheet as well.

332
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:47,879
2-0.

333
00:15:49,845 --> 00:15:51,045
I was 20, 21.

334
00:15:51,306 --> 00:15:51,928
Yeah.

335
00:15:52,449 --> 00:15:55,857
So I played six games and then I remember I lost,

336
00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:02,196
Stoke City away 3-2 with Crouchy that was that Stoke on Tuesday night alright

337
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,664
Then we lost 3-2 and then I was dropped.

338
00:16:07,085 --> 00:16:08,608
Never played for four months, six months.

339
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:14,985
Four to six months I went, you know, they rather than call me, they were in the bottom three, like so bad, they didn't win in eight games.

340
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:19,846
And I went to Gerry Paynton, who was the goalie coach, and he said, look, Rod Rand.

341
00:16:19,886 --> 00:16:20,268
I said, who?

342
00:16:20,669 --> 00:16:21,672
I didn't know where they were.

343
00:16:22,072 --> 00:16:22,754
What league?

344
00:16:22,814 --> 00:16:24,077
Is it league one, league two?

345
00:16:24,097 --> 00:16:25,119
Is it no championship?

346
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,004
And I went, you know what?

347
00:16:27,184 --> 00:16:27,445
I go.

348
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:32,578
just to play and then we lost I remember we played Sheffield Wednesday which is the derby lost 3-0

349
00:16:33,841 --> 00:16:35,602
Oh my God, we were so bad.

350
00:16:36,122 --> 00:16:38,584
And then we stayed up, we were eight games unbeaten just to play.

351
00:16:39,726 --> 00:16:45,106
Yeah, so when you say late bloomer, he wasn't given the opportunity to play in the Premier League fully until...

352
00:16:45,407 --> 00:16:46,989
But why though?

353
00:16:47,129 --> 00:16:50,613
This is what boggles my head because sitting here now in front of me,

354
00:16:51,494 --> 00:16:56,532
Again, I'm not trying to blow smoke up your ass here, but one of the best goalies in the world, right there, right now.

355
00:16:57,957 --> 00:17:02,227
How did it take to 26, 27 to get to play Premier League football?

356
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:03,551
How?

357
00:17:03,551 --> 00:17:06,866
an opportunity opportunities i think you know uh maybe i won't

358
00:17:06,866 --> 00:17:13,514
I wasn't ready if they gave me the opportunity at 21, but Shethni had it at 21, 22.

359
00:17:13,993 --> 00:17:18,401
so when I was 21 22 I was thinking yeah I'm gonna have it and I also remember

360
00:17:18,782 --> 00:17:21,110
to sit down with me and say, you're going to be my number one.

361
00:17:22,495 --> 00:17:24,580
Just wait, you're going to be my number one.

362
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,946
So Arsene Wenger, the legend, he was standing in front of you.

363
00:17:28,067 --> 00:17:29,069
You're going to be my number one.

364
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:34,445
He was signing me contract money wise, like a number two and I was number three.

365
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:38,722
I give you this because I'm thinking you're going to be my number one when he left

366
00:17:39,444 --> 00:17:44,389
I was 23, 24, and then it was a loan at Getafe which I didn't play.

367
00:17:46,615 --> 00:17:50,549
I was like, sorry, mate, but you play for Rotterdam, check for Wednesday.

368
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:53,216
you know, teams that he didn't even know.

369
00:17:53,977 --> 00:17:54,659
That killed me.

370
00:17:56,302 --> 00:17:59,928
With goalkeeping as well, it's very, very different to a lot of positions.

371
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:01,674
Sliding doors, isn't it?

372
00:18:01,694 --> 00:18:02,458
Having that right moment.

373
00:18:04,004 --> 00:18:04,525
I was good.

374
00:18:04,746 --> 00:18:05,869
I had a loan from Wolves.

375
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:07,392
Wolves offered 10 million to buy me.

376
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:09,096
That was long term.

377
00:18:09,117 --> 00:18:09,878
That was a big money.

378
00:18:10,219 --> 00:18:10,660
I fell off.

379
00:18:11,302 --> 00:18:13,726
And I was thinking about it and then, no, no, stay, stay.

380
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:14,948
They sent me a check.

381
00:18:16,532 --> 00:18:16,913
Cheers.

382
00:18:17,876 --> 00:18:18,197
Cheers.

383
00:18:18,278 --> 00:18:20,645
Like, one of the best ever goalies in the Premier League.

384
00:18:20,686 --> 00:18:21,969
So how can I...

385
00:18:21,969 --> 00:18:24,793
it was a massive climb to do again, you know?

386
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,836
So I always had always blocks on the way.

387
00:18:27,176 --> 00:18:30,109
when these obstacles keep getting put in front of you,

388
00:18:30,711 --> 00:18:33,879
did you ever lose faith that you were going to go on to do stuff?

389
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:34,941
Did you, do you know what I mean?

390
00:18:34,961 --> 00:18:35,970
Yeah, I did.

391
00:18:35,984 --> 00:18:37,307
No, I had to be honest, but,

392
00:18:37,949 --> 00:18:40,896
Six months before, I signed a six-year contract, five-year contract.

393
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:41,879
So where am I going to go now?

394
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:47,231
I had to go on loan again and that's when I started my psychology because I wanted to go home.

395
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,805
My time in England was over.

396
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:54,336
And that helped me through, you know, okay, one more loan.

397
00:18:54,657 --> 00:18:56,201
And then my son was born.

398
00:18:57,788 --> 00:18:58,451
before reading.

399
00:18:58,592 --> 00:19:01,525
So I promised to God that this is my last loan ever.

400
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:03,532
last loan ever.

401
00:19:04,073 --> 00:19:05,016
And I did that-

402
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,763
down, you want to establish yourself.

403
00:19:08,405 --> 00:19:09,046
Where are we?

404
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:09,848
I'm going to play.

405
00:19:10,129 --> 00:19:11,632
I'm going to just do it.

406
00:19:12,073 --> 00:19:16,666
So let's fast forward then to those nine games, the big nine games for Arsenal towards the end of that season.

407
00:19:18,351 --> 00:19:19,575
How nervous was you then?

408
00:19:20,137 --> 00:19:24,931
And did you sense that it was a real opportunity for you to actually stake a claim and start doing something?

409
00:19:25,322 --> 00:19:26,525
No, I didn't even think that.

410
00:19:26,846 --> 00:19:28,369
I didn't even think that fast forward.

411
00:19:29,913 --> 00:19:31,337
Something happened for a reason.

412
00:19:31,557 --> 00:19:32,139
I'm prepared.

413
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,847
Like I said, Reading, Rotterdam,

414
00:19:36,069 --> 00:19:38,411
Sheffield Wednesday, Wolves.

415
00:19:38,431 --> 00:19:40,772
I remember how much I suffered going to those places.

416
00:19:41,573 --> 00:19:46,649
cold on my own young lad you know my english wasn't great when i went to chef for wednesday

417
00:19:47,471 --> 00:19:49,073
So, I'm prepared.

418
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:53,380
Not like, oh, you didn't play for 30 games, it's only eight games you play.

419
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,145
I'm prepared, I'm prepared, I'm prepared.

420
00:19:56,305 --> 00:19:57,988
I train in COVID.

421
00:19:58,028 --> 00:19:59,612
My wife said, why are you training so much?

422
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,115
I'm training, you know, I'm training, I'm training.

423
00:20:03,175 --> 00:20:04,296
So I was prepared.

424
00:20:04,396 --> 00:20:05,918
So I went like, you know,

425
00:20:06,259 --> 00:20:07,766
I'm 25, this is my time.

426
00:20:08,268 --> 00:20:10,700
If I do bad, then this is my time for Arsenal.

427
00:20:11,302 --> 00:20:17,818
If I do well, I got a chance because I promised my mom that I was going to come back to Argentina

428
00:20:19,946 --> 00:20:21,231
I've done it.

429
00:20:21,372 --> 00:20:22,497
I want to play for my country.

430
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,177
So I'm not coming back to Argentina empty-handed.

431
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:32,567
and how do you view that ending of the arsenal center because i remember at the time as well obviously cuts was buzzing because

432
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:35,615
he's the one that was like, well, if you're not going to love him, we'll love him, all right?

433
00:20:36,176 --> 00:20:38,182
But I remember at that time, it was very much a case of,

434
00:20:38,764 --> 00:20:40,212
Who's going to be the number one goalie?

435
00:20:40,232 --> 00:20:41,741
Who's going to play next season?

436
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:45,393
And they decided to stay with Leno and decided to sell you to Aston Villa.

437
00:20:45,413 --> 00:20:47,178
How did that sit with you at that time as well?

438
00:20:47,438 --> 00:20:48,782
No, it was great.

439
00:20:48,922 --> 00:20:50,526
Obviously, you know, I knew that

440
00:20:51,508 --> 00:20:56,621
my time was over what time after winning two trophies you know for you know i'm leaving

441
00:20:57,102 --> 00:20:58,749
The final game was the FA Cup final, obviously.

442
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,115
No, it was a community championship.

443
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:00,477
Of course.

444
00:21:00,537 --> 00:21:01,739
Yeah, of course.

445
00:21:01,779 --> 00:21:02,760
It's a great ending.

446
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,763
I had a really good relationship with Mikko.

447
00:21:05,485 --> 00:21:08,741
So I thought this is the best way to leave the club, you know, on a high level.

448
00:21:09,163 --> 00:21:13,379
You know, going into a new club on a high, you know, with new teammates thinking, oh...

449
00:21:14,261 --> 00:21:16,904
Not the main man, but I'm more built now.

450
00:21:18,466 --> 00:21:20,369
And I thought it was a great step at the time.

451
00:21:20,663 --> 00:21:25,674
Okay, we're going to talk all things World Cup, a bit of shithousery as well, if you don't mind.

452
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,080
We're going to talk about that in a bit.

453
00:21:27,803 --> 00:21:29,250
Let's bring it on to Villa Cuts, okay?

454
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,897
So you've got Emi through the door now.

455
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:37,102
And you're working with this sort of 26, 27 year old kid. lad, man, giant. 

456
00:21:38,749 --> 00:21:45,009
did you do at that point then to start implementing what you wanted to do to make him into what has sort of helped be what he is now?

457
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:46,151
Just detail, really.

458
00:21:46,311 --> 00:21:47,672
Just hitting loads of detail, don't we?

459
00:21:47,692 --> 00:21:50,895
It's like, again, we had the targets on his locker.

460
00:21:52,598 --> 00:21:56,846
and just refine the finer details and making sure that

461
00:21:57,468 --> 00:21:58,553
Everything was much specific.

462
00:21:58,914 --> 00:22:01,565
Everything was built towards him, like...

463
00:22:02,066 --> 00:22:07,695
just those little one, two, three percents, just gaining and constantly improving and constantly moving forward daily.

464
00:22:08,095 --> 00:22:11,444
And when you've got somebody pushing you the same as you're pushing them, it's easy.

465
00:22:11,464 --> 00:22:12,987
They're going to do the same again, no problem.

466
00:22:13,469 --> 00:22:19,471
Like, done it, like, okay, next thing, onto it, done it, right, okay, keep moving forward, keep moving forward, keep moving forward, and then...

467
00:22:20,113 --> 00:22:23,101
Like just improvement, improvement, improvement, improvement.

468
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:26,049
Over the years, has your preparation to games changed at all?

469
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:31,628
So have you always had a similar process pre-match the night before or has that changed at all over the years?

470
00:22:32,231 --> 00:22:34,441
so many games before I went to Villa.

471
00:22:36,107 --> 00:22:40,277
Some of the loans, the goalie coach was doing really good prep and then I would just stick with it.

472
00:22:40,577 --> 00:22:42,502
I'm not really sufficient in that, but

473
00:22:43,102 --> 00:22:48,047
Since I've been obviously at Villa, I try to follow

474
00:22:48,688 --> 00:22:49,551
the same routine.

475
00:22:50,354 --> 00:22:53,324
But it's different with the national team because the coaches are different.

476
00:22:53,344 --> 00:22:54,327
Sometimes you've got more time.

477
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:56,135
Sometimes you've got less time to warm up.

478
00:22:58,685 --> 00:23:04,819
I'm not so fussy in the warm-up, it's more before the game, the day before,

479
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,067
the day before for me are key 

480
00:23:07,067 --> 00:23:09,640
okay what's your what's your kind of process are you kind of

481
00:23:10,102 --> 00:23:12,471
I'm guessing you kind of super dialed in and focused.

482
00:23:12,511 --> 00:23:16,124
Whereas I think, I think it's fair to say you guys cuts. Is this fair to say that? 

483
00:23:16,586 --> 00:23:20,746
very, very different in terms of how relaxed Ben was and...

484
00:23:22,503 --> 00:23:28,424
Yeah, in some ways, I think obviously Ben's relaxed, but had to go through what he had to go through in order to feel good.

485
00:23:28,965 --> 00:23:30,470
That's exactly the same.

486
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:34,080
He'll have his way and he'll have to tick the boxes to go, right, I need this, this, this and this and I'm done.

487
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,623
and he needs this, this, this, this, this, and this, and I'm done.

488
00:23:36,763 --> 00:23:37,525
Same things, but...

489
00:23:38,927 --> 00:23:42,341
different way of doing it like you'd sit there with a cup of tea and dunk in a biscuit like

490
00:23:42,803 --> 00:23:47,715
it's no problem like whereas i know emmy's completely different like right get me out there i wanna like i'm ready

491
00:23:47,955 --> 00:23:51,942
That was always my, whenever we played against Emi or wherever we saw him on telly,

492
00:23:53,004 --> 00:23:55,006
You were so kind of laser focused.

493
00:23:55,046 --> 00:23:57,169
I think that's been improved over the years.

494
00:23:57,549 --> 00:23:58,450
When you first came in,

495
00:23:59,832 --> 00:24:03,287
We worked a lot on him showing how he feels, like not...

496
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,332
Not showing frustration.

497
00:24:05,452 --> 00:24:07,875
Confident to the point of arrogance.

498
00:24:07,915 --> 00:24:10,419
Like how he walks, how he holds himself, how he speaks.

499
00:24:10,939 --> 00:24:12,021
Like the very best.

500
00:24:12,102 --> 00:24:13,284
I'm the very, very best.

501
00:24:13,404 --> 00:24:15,027
Like, even if he doesn't feel it, he shows it.

502
00:24:15,047 --> 00:24:17,272
Yeah, he was making me believe that I was the best in the league.

503
00:24:17,973 --> 00:24:21,381
Even though I never think that, I never think I'm the best, I'm doing the best season.

504
00:24:21,642 --> 00:24:24,408
But he was making me think, you are the best in the league.

505
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:27,958
Well, how does he do that just constantly telling you constantly?

506
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,628
Just remember confidence to the point of arrogance.

507
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:31,832
So I used to think that.

508
00:24:32,974 --> 00:24:37,499
You're right, I can be arrogant in the way I play, but she's that...

509
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,749
to give me confidence, nothing else.

510
00:24:40,091 --> 00:24:42,061
Not to show everyone, oh, he's arrogant.

511
00:24:42,624 --> 00:24:46,487
It's just to believe yourself that you are the best in the league.

512
00:24:46,607 --> 00:24:52,957
And I think if you've catered for most things in training, like match specific, we've covered it all, mate.

513
00:24:53,438 --> 00:24:53,879
You're ready.

514
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:54,982
You're ready.

515
00:24:55,222 --> 00:24:57,087
Like, nothing can stop you now.

516
00:24:57,127 --> 00:24:58,089
Like, it's the shoulders back.

517
00:24:58,671 --> 00:25:02,641
And it's that, like, training his brain to believe it.

518
00:25:02,721 --> 00:25:04,645
Like, before, when he first came in, it would be more of a...

519
00:25:05,187 --> 00:25:08,177
it'd be more of a, like, Arsenal-Villa at the time or like that.

520
00:25:08,217 --> 00:25:11,167
So he's coming to a team that were completely different for him.

521
00:25:11,608 --> 00:25:15,817
go away with Argentina sometimes and come back and go frustrated.

522
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:18,181
It's not the level.

523
00:25:18,381 --> 00:25:21,207
And he wouldn't put his shoulders back and go like,

524
00:25:22,137 --> 00:25:25,405
I'm too good for this, he'd go, that's frustrating me and this is frustrating me.

525
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:26,138
I need to get to this.

526
00:25:26,478 --> 00:25:27,581
I need the players to get to that.

527
00:25:27,641 --> 00:25:28,864
I need, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

528
00:25:29,104 --> 00:25:30,225
That's not, that's not your job.

529
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:31,386
You ain't got to worry about that.

530
00:25:32,007 --> 00:25:33,088
You just be the best.

531
00:25:33,128 --> 00:25:35,910
Like you just do what you do day in, day out gaming.

532
00:25:36,071 --> 00:25:38,177
game out, the rest will speak for itself.

533
00:25:38,197 --> 00:25:40,163
Did that help you at first when you signed for Villa where

534
00:25:40,424 --> 00:25:42,748
You knew you were going to be busy and you were busy, wasn't you?

535
00:25:42,788 --> 00:25:43,789
You're making saves.

536
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:44,931
You're having to be called on.

537
00:25:45,071 --> 00:25:47,576
in every single game to save Aston Villa, basically.

538
00:25:47,616 --> 00:25:49,960
Did that help sort of raise that confidence as well?

539
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,222
Yeah, it was huge.

540
00:25:51,523 --> 00:25:52,845
It was huge.

541
00:25:53,165 --> 00:25:55,549
Normally, Arsenal and a big club, a national team,

542
00:25:56,090 --> 00:26:01,772
you get two shots, but two good ones, 1v1 or a clear shot.

543
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:08,538
and Avila was just deflection after deflection, crosses, but I thought it was good, I'm reactive.

544
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:13,196
I'm really good in the air, kicking a lot of balls.

545
00:26:13,216 --> 00:26:14,843
I wasn't used to kick so many balls.

546
00:26:15,143 --> 00:26:16,306
I'm really good kicker of the ball.

547
00:26:16,766 --> 00:26:19,331
So I feel like, oh, if I get all these things right,

548
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:20,955
I can really help the team.

549
00:26:21,095 --> 00:26:22,519
But then I was going with the national team.

550
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,744
When I was playing for Argentina, I was like,

551
00:26:25,506 --> 00:26:26,567
Made that's so easy.

552
00:26:27,228 --> 00:26:29,512
You know, it was so easy.

553
00:26:29,572 --> 00:26:30,654
Why why is it so much easier?

554
00:26:31,015 --> 00:26:31,195
Why?

555
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:32,977
Because I was doing so much for the villa.

556
00:26:33,618 --> 00:26:34,119
So much.

557
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:34,900
Involved in everything.

558
00:26:35,141 --> 00:26:37,933
I made 160 saves I think in the first season.

559
00:26:38,495 --> 00:26:42,408
So when I was going with the national team, making one or two saves, clean sheet, clean sheet, clean sheet.

560
00:26:42,488 --> 00:26:45,652
I think I got like 30 clean sheets in 37 games for my country.

561
00:26:46,302 --> 00:26:48,371
So it was so easy.

562
00:26:48,913 --> 00:26:49,896
do you notice the opposition?

563
00:26:49,936 --> 00:26:55,469
So when you go away with Argentina, they won't press you so much because they know they're happy to let you have the ball, basically.

564
00:26:55,796 --> 00:26:57,261
Kind of takes the stress off a bit, doesn't it?

565
00:26:58,204 --> 00:27:01,956
The first few games with the national team, the manager did not want me to play from the back.

566
00:27:02,658 --> 00:27:03,480
No, he hated it.

567
00:27:03,941 --> 00:27:08,351
Now in the national team, we play a lot with the back because they also in my team, they watch you every game.

568
00:27:09,073 --> 00:27:11,222
for Aston Villa, so they trust you more.

569
00:27:12,949 --> 00:27:13,893
He went at half-time.

570
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:15,017
We played Uruguay at home.

571
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,382
He hates playing from the back.

572
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:17,426
He's that old school manager.

573
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:24,279
It was me, McAllister, Enzo Fernandez, De Paul playing with Romero.

574
00:27:25,361 --> 00:27:26,384
They're all good footballers.

575
00:27:26,404 --> 00:27:26,966
Yeah, ballers.

576
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:30,015
So we were doing the 1-2, 1-2 from the back.

577
00:27:30,135 --> 00:27:31,058
If you guys want to play...

578
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:31,962
You do it.

579
00:27:32,062 --> 00:27:32,825
But I don't like it.

580
00:27:32,926 --> 00:27:33,568
It was a halftime.

581
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,617
And we went, we're going to keep doing it.

582
00:27:36,741 --> 00:27:38,289
So that's a national team.

583
00:27:38,309 --> 00:27:40,358
The level of me is just incredible.

584
00:27:41,121 --> 00:27:42,024
I can imagine.

585
00:27:42,324 --> 00:27:44,550
Let's sort of fast forward with Villa a little bit then.

586
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:49,587
I think the progression of Villa over the last couple of years in particular has been incredible.

587
00:27:51,272 --> 00:27:56,020
It was probably the catalyst was when Unai Emery came into Aston Villa, took over from Steven Gerrard.

588
00:27:57,282 --> 00:27:57,743
I'm on the sack.

589
00:27:58,143 --> 00:27:58,525
Pardon, sorry?

590
00:27:58,585 --> 00:27:59,168
And I got the sack.

591
00:27:59,389 --> 00:28:01,358
And then you got the sack, unfortunately.

592
00:28:02,202 --> 00:28:05,239
um actually that might be an interesting thing to talk about actually is

593
00:28:05,661 --> 00:28:11,900
is how that dynamic works then is because a new manager comes in, he brings his own staff in, cuts, unfortunately gets sacked.

594
00:28:12,882 --> 00:28:17,889
How does that work from a goalie's perspective then when you are expected to just start up with another goalie coach?

595
00:28:18,871 --> 00:28:22,704
I think having the same spot director and the same CEO, I thought he was fine.

596
00:28:22,785 --> 00:28:25,003
I said, no, I can't.

597
00:28:25,414 --> 00:28:26,557
Stay here, we're all for you.

598
00:28:26,617 --> 00:28:27,439
You brought me here.

599
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,566
I'm Argentinian number one.

600
00:28:30,831 --> 00:28:31,667
I put my name...

601
00:28:32,694 --> 00:28:37,047
higher obviously in the ranks and I said you'll be fine and then I remember saying like look

602
00:28:37,628 --> 00:28:39,854
I'm getting sacked and it was a big shock for me.

603
00:28:39,894 --> 00:28:40,957
You know what I'm saying?

604
00:28:40,977 --> 00:28:42,361
We knew the relationship we had.

605
00:28:43,044 --> 00:28:45,957
how comfortable I was with him on and off the pitch.

606
00:28:47,663 --> 00:28:52,176
that I went to the club, to the CEO, to the director, and said, there's nothing we can do.

607
00:28:52,538 --> 00:28:55,475
as a manager decision that's a new staff decision and

608
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,107
I knew Javi, so I knew Javi wouldn't do that.

609
00:29:00,988 --> 00:29:06,236
probably meet him, talk to him and then work alongside him because that's how I know Javi.

610
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,427
So it was quite difficult knowing he doesn't have a club.

611
00:29:10,507 --> 00:29:12,873
Obviously, I didn't have that relationship day in, day out.

612
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,530
So it was a difficult period for me last year.

613
00:29:19,356 --> 00:29:22,306
because I was going to a World Cup as well, so I couldn't really

614
00:29:22,546 --> 00:29:26,403
a lot of changes a lot of changes so it was hard that season was hard for me

615
00:29:26,604 --> 00:29:31,231
And what's that like from your point of view then because I'm guessing that that's probably

616
00:29:31,893 --> 00:29:37,935
one of the biggest sort of worries and scares of being a football coach or a goalie coach, assistant manager, anything like that,

617
00:29:38,496 --> 00:29:42,386
If that manager gets sacked, then you're kind of fearing for your job as well.

618
00:29:42,426 --> 00:29:43,308
Because it's without...

619
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,195
It's not within your control.

620
00:29:45,697 --> 00:29:47,122
How do you not take that personally?

621
00:29:50,012 --> 00:29:56,046
I think you have to when you take the job you feel like it's part and parcel a little bit so when you take the job you know there's a chance of it happening so you have to

622
00:29:56,167 --> 00:29:58,899
put that to the back of your mind and go right okay if it happens it happens

623
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:03,337
And I'm all about the development of the goalies, right?

624
00:30:03,518 --> 00:30:04,140
I'm all about...

625
00:30:04,923 --> 00:30:08,391
leaving the place better than when I found it.

626
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:11,558
I'm all about every day, if I get the sack, I get the sack, but I've left it better.

627
00:30:11,778 --> 00:30:12,459
Miles better.

628
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:14,482
That goalie unit, the whole goalie unit.

629
00:30:14,522 --> 00:30:16,425
That unit is, that department.

630
00:30:16,986 --> 00:30:21,054
is so much better than when I found it and when I took control of it.

631
00:30:21,776 --> 00:30:22,678
And I can, like...

632
00:30:23,379 --> 00:30:27,594
I don't know, like when you get the sack and you don't know why you've got the sack, you can't learn, can you?

633
00:30:28,075 --> 00:30:31,106
So it's like somebody who doesn't sat me down and gone, I've sat you because of these reasons.

634
00:30:31,146 --> 00:30:32,250
And you go, right, that's fair enough.

635
00:30:32,371 --> 00:30:32,993
I'll learn from that.

636
00:30:33,715 --> 00:30:34,598
That was the thing for me.

637
00:30:34,618 --> 00:30:38,567
I wanted somebody to sit me down and go, right, you've not done this and you've not done that, and that was poor.

638
00:30:39,108 --> 00:30:40,552
And then you can go away and go, right, that's how it is.

639
00:30:40,632 --> 00:30:41,054
to improve.

640
00:30:41,174 --> 00:30:42,399
But is it not just circumstantial?

641
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,426
You know that deep down you go...

642
00:30:45,108 --> 00:30:49,305
it's because they're bringing in their own literally collateral damage isn't it they're bringing in their own stuff 

643
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:51,563
so in the end you just go right okay I've just been sacked and that's it but

644
00:30:52,866 --> 00:30:55,776
to get sacked and then see someone that you've worked with

645
00:30:56,337 --> 00:30:59,466
like so closely win the World Cup was just like,

646
00:30:59,928 --> 00:31:00,670
was everything for me.

647
00:31:00,911 --> 00:31:01,934
It was massive.

648
00:31:01,954 --> 00:31:04,261
All my family, we went on holiday.

649
00:31:04,723 --> 00:31:05,926
We're like, we all watched it together.

650
00:31:06,327 --> 00:31:10,557
He said, I promise you, if you win the World Cup, you give me a FaceTime after the game.

651
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:12,740
That's what I was going to ask you.

652
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:15,783
How quickly after you won the World Cup did you... In the changing room.

653
00:31:15,843 --> 00:31:16,544
In the changing room.

654
00:31:16,564 --> 00:31:17,289
Yeah, yeah.

655
00:31:17,785 --> 00:31:21,876
But to be fair, the club was good, I promise you.

656
00:31:22,538 --> 00:31:26,473
we gave him a year of his salary, you know, we're going to look after

657
00:31:26,935 --> 00:31:28,201
A couple million quid, I think, wasn't it?

658
00:31:28,221 --> 00:31:29,044
Yeah, three or five.

659
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:34,639
No, the club kept their promise, so that's what it's about.

660
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,541
They're quite good.

661
00:31:36,542 --> 00:31:37,584
And it is, it's one of them, isn't it?

662
00:31:37,865 --> 00:31:42,000
I kind of, when I got, I've never been out football since I was 16, ever.

663
00:31:42,713 --> 00:31:45,568
And I got the sack and I just went, oh, God.

664
00:31:45,588 --> 00:31:46,413
I got a family again, eh?

665
00:31:46,573 --> 00:31:50,885
yeah like you just need that breather it's not until you stop you go oh my god like

666
00:31:51,286 --> 00:31:51,928
I needed that.

667
00:31:52,168 --> 00:31:52,910
I needed the break.

668
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:55,376
I needed like four or five months of just like calm.

669
00:31:55,817 --> 00:32:00,004
So interesting you say that because Rob Paul Robinson said this exact same thing, didn't they?

670
00:32:00,264 --> 00:32:01,308
He said, from 16 to 38.

671
00:32:01,589 --> 00:32:03,175
That's all you need.

672
00:32:03,316 --> 00:32:05,464
Like the pressures of football, you don't realise, like...

673
00:32:05,926 --> 00:32:10,077
while you're in it you can't see the woods for the trees like you don't realize the pressure and

674
00:32:10,479 --> 00:32:13,617
and the time it's taken daily like getting in at half seven

675
00:32:13,939 --> 00:32:16,241
You're not leaving until half six, seven o'clock at night.

676
00:32:16,261 --> 00:32:16,821
You're going home.

677
00:32:16,861 --> 00:32:17,202
Repeat.

678
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:18,322
Pressure of winning games.

679
00:32:18,383 --> 00:32:19,123
Pressure of winning games.

680
00:32:19,183 --> 00:32:20,024
Pressure of winning games.

681
00:32:21,867 --> 00:32:25,733
How did you say when you kind of took you you kind of took that breath what I

682
00:32:26,542 --> 00:32:27,745
What was your mentality like?

683
00:32:27,805 --> 00:32:31,211
Were you, I want to get back in, or let's just take a minute?

684
00:32:31,231 --> 00:32:32,033
Let's just take a minute.

685
00:32:32,734 --> 00:32:33,155
needed it.

686
00:32:33,676 --> 00:32:34,498
I really needed it.

687
00:32:34,698 --> 00:32:38,465
And I had a couple of offers that I thought, I can't, and decent ones.

688
00:32:39,426 --> 00:32:40,527
And I thought, I'm not ready.

689
00:32:40,787 --> 00:32:41,808
Like, I can't do it.

690
00:32:42,368 --> 00:32:43,069
I needed the break.

691
00:32:43,249 --> 00:32:44,830
I felt kind of burnt out.

692
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:45,371
I felt like

693
00:32:46,252 --> 00:32:46,933
And it wasn't until I stopped.

694
00:32:46,953 --> 00:32:47,995
If I'd have kept going, I'd have been fine.

695
00:32:48,035 --> 00:32:50,098
But I stopped and gone, Jesus, like, I need it.

696
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,467
Did you start to appreciate the things that you missed out?

697
00:32:53,487 --> 00:32:56,155
Because I know when you retired from Watford, Ben, you...

698
00:32:56,857 --> 00:33:00,715
you found pleasure in the small things in life, like having a weekend, going to the Friday night.

699
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,005
Friday night's incredible.

700
00:33:03,046 --> 00:33:03,608
Do you know this?

701
00:33:03,729 --> 00:33:04,674
Friday night's incredible.

702
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,474
You can go to the pub and stuff.

703
00:33:08,494 --> 00:33:09,560
You can have a beer and that.

704
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:16,518
chill you ain't gonna worry about getting up in the morning because the most you see yourself though footballers they kind of get a lot more insular towards the end of the week and

705
00:33:16,658 --> 00:33:18,644
because that stress starts to come on, doesn't it?

706
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:20,589
And it's like, the game's here tomorrow,

707
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:21,852
You haven't got any of that.

708
00:33:21,872 --> 00:33:23,035
It's incredible, let me be honest.

709
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,118
It's incredible.

710
00:33:24,138 --> 00:33:24,880
I don't want to feel it here.

711
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,105
Give me a few more years.

712
00:33:28,695 --> 00:33:31,718
I go all in, so they mean everything to me, like everything.

713
00:33:32,018 --> 00:33:33,960
I do whatever it takes to make them better.

714
00:33:35,241 --> 00:33:37,365
all day, every day, constantly in my mind, like, how do I do this?

715
00:33:37,385 --> 00:33:38,086
Where am I going to do this?

716
00:33:38,106 --> 00:33:38,947
How am I going to make him better?

717
00:33:38,967 --> 00:33:40,229
What am I going to do in training?

718
00:33:40,609 --> 00:33:41,772
How are we going to be at the game?

719
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:44,298
Is what we need to do to implement the game, the following game?

720
00:33:44,499 --> 00:33:46,103
What do we put rightly into the next game?

721
00:33:46,123 --> 00:33:47,406
And it's just like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

722
00:33:48,347 --> 00:33:49,009
And you just need to go.

723
00:33:49,389 --> 00:33:49,810
I've got to say, I...

724
00:33:51,232 --> 00:33:53,258
I've worked with some really good goalie coaches in my time.

725
00:33:53,499 --> 00:33:54,682
I have never seen anybody

726
00:33:55,283 --> 00:34:00,688
take on this goalie department unit and make it their baby like I have seen Neil Cutler do.

727
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:01,531
It genuinely is.

728
00:34:01,571 --> 00:34:02,615
It's like your baby, isn't it?

729
00:34:02,855 --> 00:34:03,919
It's like the whole thing.

730
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:06,729
And you're talking goalie coaches underneath of you,

731
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:11,579
You're talking like academy goalies, young goalies under 12, 34, all the way through.

732
00:34:11,619 --> 00:34:13,001
You're talking a lot of people, aren't you?

733
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:18,094
And you came in, I remember at West Brom and it was like, yeah, this is all of mine and I will take charge of it.

734
00:34:18,194 --> 00:34:19,538
It was good to see, to be fair.

735
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:23,688
I feel like I've improved as I got older and more knowledgeable.

736
00:34:23,868 --> 00:34:26,073
And since being with them and since...

737
00:34:27,076 --> 00:34:30,523
Obviously me going on to what he did even more confidence to take that on and

738
00:34:30,844 --> 00:34:35,498
like even more confidence to implement my ideas and my philosophy and what I think

739
00:34:35,959 --> 00:34:42,411
to other coaches because you do you gain that bit more every step you go a bit more confident a bit more knowledgeable a bit more experienced and then

740
00:34:42,932 --> 00:34:47,471
you feel like you can implement it with more, I don't know, a bit more aggressively.

741
00:34:47,632 --> 00:34:48,134
Authority.

742
00:34:48,415 --> 00:34:49,619
A bit more authority.

743
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,563
It's proven.

744
00:34:50,703 --> 00:34:51,085
It works.

745
00:34:51,245 --> 00:34:51,928
Yeah, it's proven.

746
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:58,247
I mean, like you were saying, with every loan that you get, I know that loan at Katafe that didn't quite work out.

747
00:34:58,548 --> 00:35:02,381
getting sacked, it all just makes, rightly or wrongly, it makes you better, doesn't it?

748
00:35:02,622 --> 00:35:04,267
And Javi's a really good coach, by the way.

749
00:35:04,909 --> 00:35:09,639
he's come on and you've just kept doing that and that's massively important to me like it's not somebody come in and

750
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:16,646
ripped apart what we've done over those years Javi's come in and gone no we just keep building we just keep getting better and it's just that's massively important

751
00:35:16,866 --> 00:35:19,213
Emi, can we ask and pick your brain?

752
00:35:19,233 --> 00:35:21,098
Because I wasn't aware of this rule.

753
00:35:21,399 --> 00:35:22,247
Cutlerz, were you?

754
00:35:23,023 --> 00:35:23,712
Incredible.

755
00:35:23,945 --> 00:35:25,849
It's like they just make up rules when they want to, basically.

756
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:29,656
I want to talk about the Conference League quarterfinal, the penalty shootout.

757
00:35:29,716 --> 00:35:31,179
So you've already got a yellow card in the game.

758
00:35:32,682 --> 00:35:35,416
And then you get another yellow card in the penalty shootout.

759
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:40,663
Were you aware that that meant you were going to miss the first leg of the semi-final?

760
00:35:41,544 --> 00:35:42,545
Mate, I was like...

761
00:35:43,956 --> 00:35:45,459
You know, it was the game started.

762
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:47,943
So the fan was having a go at me because I was in France.

763
00:35:48,003 --> 00:35:49,846
Obviously they remember the World Cup final.

764
00:35:50,027 --> 00:35:53,666
So the fans were straight up muted since the start of the game.

765
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:58,246
And the Reds, the first goal kick, he went, I'm going to book you.

766
00:35:58,647 --> 00:36:01,055
I said, mate, I'm just getting the ball.

767
00:36:01,316 --> 00:36:03,903
I was asking the ball for the ball boy.

768
00:36:04,566 --> 00:36:07,139
And because they probably were French, they would not give me the ball.

769
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:08,103
I had to go and get it.

770
00:36:08,786 --> 00:36:10,248
And he was like, stop wasting time.

771
00:36:10,428 --> 00:36:11,049
I'm going to book you.

772
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:12,811
First goal kick.

773
00:36:14,294 --> 00:36:16,541
I got booked after 25 minutes, never seen before.

774
00:36:16,601 --> 00:36:17,845
Losing 1-0, got booked.

775
00:36:18,768 --> 00:36:19,310
Don't ask me why.

776
00:36:21,075 --> 00:36:23,501
The game was on and the penalty shootout.

777
00:36:24,042 --> 00:36:30,498
So the Red was like straight up going at me because he knew me, probably watched videos about me.

778
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,829
So he knew how I behaved in the penalty shootout.

779
00:36:35,514 --> 00:36:39,667
uh so save the first plane obviously i shoot the crowd because they were having a stick at me at the

780
00:36:39,807 --> 00:36:44,012
Whole games, insulting me, throwing me coins, lighters, the whole game.

781
00:36:45,777 --> 00:36:50,732
But then I see the first band and their players must go into the crowd.

782
00:36:50,973 --> 00:36:53,016
So there was no ball on the pitch.

783
00:36:53,717 --> 00:36:57,001
So then I turned and I was asking the ball to the ball boy.

784
00:36:57,341 --> 00:37:03,606
I didn't want my teammate to wait to take the pen because I know the pressure.

785
00:37:03,932 --> 00:37:06,007
are you aware of that now are you fully aware of that now 

786
00:37:06,007 --> 00:37:10,588
please can you give me the ball and the ref went and she's with the yellow so I'm off

787
00:37:11,911 --> 00:37:16,020
I got a yellow I'm off I said ref I'm asking for the ball and then he was just walking off

788
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:19,922
I thought, am I off or did he gave me the yellow?

789
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:21,533
Are you thinking, don't say anything?

790
00:37:23,204 --> 00:37:23,745
Get back in goal.

791
00:37:24,016 --> 00:37:29,104
And you see all the players from Lille, he's got yellow, he's got yellow.

792
00:37:29,605 --> 00:37:30,709
I said, no, no, no, it's not off.

793
00:37:30,889 --> 00:37:32,072
I know he's got yellow.

794
00:37:32,152 --> 00:37:32,674
He was a ref.

795
00:37:32,955 --> 00:37:34,940
And Douglas was, Dougie, just tell him.

796
00:37:35,381 --> 00:37:39,529
because I was going to be the captain, but I said, Doggy, you just keep the armband.

797
00:37:39,569 --> 00:37:39,950
I don't want it.

798
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,173
for the shooter.

799
00:37:41,234 --> 00:37:43,743
I just want to concentrate on penalties, you know.

800
00:37:46,246 --> 00:37:50,729
And then they told me after the game that I missed the semi-final because I got two yellows

801
00:37:51,089 --> 00:37:52,680
in one game, 

802
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,419
and they say that

803
00:37:55,433 --> 00:37:59,139
When you play in a semi-final, quarter-finals, then you get two yellows.

804
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,422
It doesn't count in shootout.

805
00:38:02,562 --> 00:38:04,563
Shootout is like a different game.

806
00:38:05,926 --> 00:38:09,377
I said, how can I be suspended for the first leg in the semi-final?

807
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:12,203
If the shootout is not part of the leg.

808
00:38:13,967 --> 00:38:20,446
So it worked the same as if you got a yellow card in the first leg and a yellow card in the second leg, you would miss the first leg of the semifinal then?

809
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:21,368
That's how it worked.

810
00:38:21,489 --> 00:38:25,521
No, I had a yellow at Villa Park for time-wasting.

811
00:38:25,882 --> 00:38:30,369
You've got three yellow cards and two... And then I've got a yellow card in the corner.

812
00:38:31,031 --> 00:38:35,311
in the second leg but I asked the club he said if I get a yellow card

813
00:38:35,692 --> 00:38:37,577
In France, will I miss the semi-final?

814
00:38:37,597 --> 00:38:40,242
I said, no, with two yellows, you won't miss the semi-final.

815
00:38:41,425 --> 00:38:44,590
So I said, okay, so that was, you know, for if we winning,

816
00:38:45,271 --> 00:38:47,717
Late in the game, I would just calm myself down.

817
00:38:47,837 --> 00:38:49,722
Even if I get a yellow, I don't mean the semi-final.

818
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:50,704
It was checked.

819
00:38:50,864 --> 00:38:51,365
It was all good.

820
00:38:52,668 --> 00:38:58,884
And then when it's three yellows, the UEFA said, what are we doing now?

821
00:38:59,204 --> 00:39:03,674
So they decided at that time, they made the app that couldn't play the semifinals.

822
00:39:03,915 --> 00:39:04,837
Like they punished me.

823
00:39:05,458 --> 00:39:07,010
Have for having three yellows 

824
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:11,678
there that I think they might have all sort of looked at you haven't gone There's no way on this earth anybody

825
00:39:11,686 --> 00:39:13,391
can be that much of a shit house, right?

826
00:39:13,832 --> 00:39:16,419
To get three yellow cards in two games, it's impossible, right?

827
00:39:16,841 --> 00:39:19,959
I put all my money that no one knew in football that...

828
00:39:21,204 --> 00:39:23,869
If you get two yellows in one game, you will not get a red card.

829
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:25,392
No one knew in football.

830
00:39:26,452 --> 00:39:30,167
I would just like to say, are you aware now though, you know, that when, if you're playing in a game,

831
00:39:30,327 --> 00:39:35,108
and it goes to a penalty shootout, are you aware that everybody knows exactly how that penalty shootout is going to end?

832
00:39:35,509 --> 00:39:35,970
Do you know that?

833
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:37,213
Even their players.

834
00:39:38,235 --> 00:39:41,563
I remember against Lille, the ball was in between

835
00:39:42,285 --> 00:39:45,756
me and the little player, I can't remember his name.

836
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:48,165
So I ran into the ball, he was sprinting.

837
00:39:48,706 --> 00:39:49,549
Because he knew me.

838
00:39:50,572 --> 00:39:52,960
And then I got the ball and I left it on the floor like that.

839
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:57,592
pulled him off already so then when he missed a pen he smashed the ball into the crowd like

840
00:39:58,435 --> 00:40:01,427
really upset for my god I went into his head already

841
00:40:03,094 --> 00:40:04,156
It's so easy now.

842
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:05,438
It's easy.

843
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,326
Mate, and I thought, it's a young lad, Gomez, from Lille.

844
00:40:10,068 --> 00:40:14,778
And I promise you, for my kid, when he was putting the ball on the floor, he was shaking.

845
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,348
That's when my mum's life, it was actually shaking so far.

846
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:21,657
But I already had a yellow, so I thought if you eat a reference,

847
00:40:21,917 --> 00:40:24,503
booked me in the shootout, how can I be off?

848
00:40:25,144 --> 00:40:26,487
So I couldn't do anything.

849
00:40:27,329 --> 00:40:31,078
stupid or what I wanted to do because I already had a yellow in the game.

850
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:32,581
Incredible.

851
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:33,662
World class.

852
00:40:33,702 --> 00:40:34,022
Weird.

853
00:40:34,143 --> 00:40:34,843
I'm thinking everything.

854
00:40:35,104 --> 00:40:35,824
Incredible.

855
00:40:36,405 --> 00:40:37,406
Shall we do some World Cup chat?

856
00:40:37,566 --> 00:40:38,850
Oh, we've got to do well, 

857
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:40,294
Right, this is the bit earlier, right?

858
00:40:40,314 --> 00:40:43,322
When I was prepping for this Emi, I was giggling to myself.

859
00:40:43,342 --> 00:40:43,723
I was like...

860
00:40:43,783 --> 00:40:45,966
Honestly, I was so excited about this.

861
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:46,327
Giddy.

862
00:40:46,627 --> 00:40:47,909
Giddy is what I was, right?

863
00:40:48,149 --> 00:40:48,410
Giddy.

864
00:40:49,591 --> 00:40:52,755
We've got to start with... So forget the rest of the game, right?

865
00:40:52,775 --> 00:40:54,056
The rest of the game was incredible.

866
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:54,717
It was fantastic.

867
00:40:54,797 --> 00:40:55,098
It was...

868
00:40:55,638 --> 00:41:00,886
about as good a, not even World Cup fight, as good a game as football as you could wish to watch, wasn't it?

869
00:41:01,406 --> 00:41:02,528
a guarantee playing as well.

870
00:41:02,828 --> 00:41:05,932
It's like it was written by a Hollywood producer or something.

871
00:41:05,972 --> 00:41:06,773
It was phenomenal, right?

872
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:13,319
I'm going to transport you though to the 122nd minute and 40 seconds, 42 seconds actually.

873
00:41:14,163 --> 00:41:17,276
And Kolo Mwani just gets put through and...

874
00:41:18,802 --> 00:41:23,698
And I want to know now from a goalkeeper's perspective, everything.

875
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,221
Absolutely everything.

876
00:41:25,261 --> 00:41:28,486
Everything that's going through your mind, cuts I want to know you, technical details,

877
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:31,227
Everything that's gone on, break it down for me, Emi.

878
00:41:33,752 --> 00:41:37,217
The first thing I always say, I didn't think it was that good, the save.

879
00:41:37,718 --> 00:41:38,020
Wow.

880
00:41:38,281 --> 00:41:40,655
I made better saves than that, but...

881
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:46,228
I expect Otamendi to miss the ball.

882
00:41:47,049 --> 00:41:47,911
You'd already read that.

883
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:51,828
Look Ben, I was having a comfortable game

884
00:41:52,371 --> 00:41:58,072
you know really comfortable really good with the ball of my feet 75 minutes then i can see two goals or three goals in

885
00:41:58,493 --> 00:41:58,834
Two minutes.

886
00:41:58,854 --> 00:42:03,660
Out of nothing with two penalties and one goal we impacted and maybe I should have a strong hand on it.

887
00:42:05,885 --> 00:42:07,528
And then I was so comfortable,

888
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:12,825
calm in that situation for, oh no, Otis is going to miss it, Otis is going to miss it, Otis is going to miss it.

889
00:42:13,006 --> 00:42:13,749
And then he does it.

890
00:42:13,909 --> 00:42:14,411
So then I'm,

891
00:42:15,053 --> 00:42:17,436
I'm calm because I'm already expecting him to miss it.

892
00:42:18,658 --> 00:42:23,149
If I'm not expecting Otamendi to miss a ball, I don't think I'm going to save that ball.

893
00:42:24,052 --> 00:42:27,142
And I'm, you know, I remember the Maria score

894
00:42:27,463 --> 00:42:31,860
against Brazil in the Maracanã when Edison came out and Di Maria just looped over him.

895
00:42:32,362 --> 00:42:35,295
So if you're running, he's going to loop it.

896
00:42:35,657 --> 00:42:37,400
So Edison was running out towards him.

897
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:40,866
It was Di Maria and we won the Copa America because Di Maria looped him.

898
00:42:42,567 --> 00:42:47,817
So I thought, that came into my head, even though it was so close, I said, I'm staying.

899
00:42:48,378 --> 00:42:51,975
And then how the ball was travelling, then I was adjusting to the ball.

900
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:56,048
Because if I was staying too deep, he had a pass.

901
00:42:57,051 --> 00:42:59,238
He could square the pass into, I think it was in pass.

902
00:42:59,338 --> 00:43:03,664
So I thought, okay, I close the goal, I close the goal, I close the goal.

903
00:43:04,405 --> 00:43:06,388
And then because, you know, Ben, you've been a goalkeeper.

904
00:43:06,428 --> 00:43:09,152
So if you run to him, they're still looking at you.

905
00:43:09,352 --> 00:43:09,593
Yeah.

906
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:10,956
Even though his head's down.

907
00:43:11,277 --> 00:43:13,001
Even though they're down, they can look at you.

908
00:43:13,021 --> 00:43:15,827
So then, you know, any striker, top class, whoosh,

909
00:43:16,428 --> 00:43:18,393
That's it, you lose the World Cup.

910
00:43:18,413 --> 00:43:23,105
So I keep my cool, I go into the angle, and then when he's about to shoot, I fall.

911
00:43:24,846 --> 00:43:29,210
I work with German goalkeepers, with English goalkeepers and South American goalkeepers.

912
00:43:30,291 --> 00:43:35,378
normally the German they stay up with the hands high and they choose robotic

913
00:43:35,999 --> 00:43:37,783
The English light, they spread.

914
00:43:38,584 --> 00:43:39,987
In South America, they guess.

915
00:43:41,249 --> 00:43:42,391
That's the style.

916
00:43:42,471 --> 00:43:46,816
So if I guess and then I guess wrong, then

917
00:43:47,497 --> 00:43:47,939
Game over.

918
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:48,642
Game over.

919
00:43:48,803 --> 00:43:50,249
So if I stay like German...

920
00:43:51,334 --> 00:43:54,607
maybe, you know, you can't really go sideways.

921
00:43:54,668 --> 00:43:55,913
So if I spread,

922
00:43:56,535 --> 00:43:59,661
Maybe I don't cover how much I want to cover.

923
00:44:00,042 --> 00:44:02,027
Okay, this is all going through your head, yeah?

924
00:44:02,227 --> 00:44:04,112
This is in these split seconds.

925
00:44:04,172 --> 00:44:05,876
By the time he's going to shoot, he'll say, what am I doing?

926
00:44:06,337 --> 00:44:07,921
You need to make a decision.

927
00:44:07,981 --> 00:44:10,406
Or you go, you stay, or you jump, or you go low.

928
00:44:11,188 --> 00:44:15,664
So I thought, look, the way I was cutting the angle diagonally, I thought,

929
00:44:16,366 --> 00:44:20,494
if he goes across, he can miss on the bullet.

930
00:44:21,255 --> 00:44:22,076
If he goes across,

931
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:27,654
The ball is going away from the goal and I'm going diagonally that way

932
00:44:27,996 --> 00:44:31,734
to the towards the left so for that left side is quite open

933
00:44:32,257 --> 00:44:33,341
because I'm going forwards.

934
00:44:33,401 --> 00:44:34,204
I know where the goal is.

935
00:44:34,445 --> 00:44:37,577
I know exactly where the goal is because I can see the penalty spot there.

936
00:44:38,461 --> 00:44:40,450
So I thought, he's going to go there.

937
00:44:41,956 --> 00:44:44,024
This is the thing we work a lot.

938
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:47,734
body shape regarding to the ball.

939
00:44:48,135 --> 00:44:48,917
The ball is bouncing.

940
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:50,844
So I don't keep my hands low.

941
00:44:51,687 --> 00:44:53,132
Normally it's a 1v1 low.

942
00:44:53,955 --> 00:44:55,139
You keep your hands quite low.

943
00:44:56,304 --> 00:45:00,578
The ball is bouncing, so if I keep my hands low, I leave all this open.

944
00:45:01,321 --> 00:45:04,016
So I thought, I'm guessing...

945
00:45:04,699 --> 00:45:07,322
without actually diving, that's going to go left.

946
00:45:07,582 --> 00:45:10,726
So my left leg and my left hand is really strong.

947
00:45:11,266 --> 00:45:12,794
you know you put rock solid in your hands.

948
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:15,868
So I thought, please hit me, my face straight to the ball.

949
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:19,503
And then I'm praying that the ball is going to go left.

950
00:45:19,563 --> 00:45:20,829
Then you can save it or not.

951
00:45:21,632 --> 00:45:25,182
But then I did not move, you know, keep myself square.

952
00:45:25,483 --> 00:45:27,630
It's just brain that's going to go to that side, you know.

953
00:45:28,011 --> 00:45:30,908
and this one and you just leave it just in case you know strong as well

954
00:45:31,972 --> 00:45:34,396
And it was so quick that we nearly won it.

955
00:45:34,757 --> 00:45:37,281
And then obviously after the game, the save was huge.

956
00:45:37,883 --> 00:45:39,229
At the time, it was just so quick.

957
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:41,601
Massive like.

958
00:45:44,064 --> 00:45:50,095
Everything you just said there is hours and hours and hours of work that he's done over the years.

959
00:45:51,036 --> 00:45:55,183
holding his shape for long periods of time and having the balls to go, nah,

960
00:45:55,865 --> 00:45:58,436
I'm not triggering, I'm not falling back.

961
00:45:59,019 --> 00:46:04,398
My hand position in relation to ball distance and body position in relation to ball distance is spot on.

962
00:46:05,181 --> 00:46:06,026
And you ain't beating me.

963
00:46:06,247 --> 00:46:08,743
Like you can see, it's just like, I'm not conceding.

964
00:46:09,104 --> 00:46:13,219
Like if you stay up and hold, don't trigger, don't fall back.

965
00:46:13,239 --> 00:46:14,162
So biomechanically,

966
00:46:14,744 --> 00:46:15,969
Perfect.

967
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:17,354
His shoulders haven't rotated.

968
00:46:17,394 --> 00:46:18,940
His hands haven't triggered.

969
00:46:19,361 --> 00:46:20,784
The body weight's not falling back.

970
00:46:20,864 --> 00:46:21,485
Face.

971
00:46:22,267 --> 00:46:24,592
Can you explain what triggering is for the viewers, please?

972
00:46:25,006 --> 00:46:28,629
So a lot of goalies, well, goalies can trick.

973
00:46:28,649 --> 00:46:31,071
So as soon as the ball's hit, what does your body want to do?

974
00:46:31,854 --> 00:46:34,468
Naturally, your body will want to go, woof, it's coming quick now.

975
00:46:35,191 --> 00:46:38,577
So a lot of goalies will trigger the hands backwards to come forward.

976
00:46:38,597 --> 00:46:41,782
But as soon as your hands go backwards, how does that affect your body weight?

977
00:46:42,162 --> 00:46:43,305
What's your body weight going to want to do?

978
00:46:43,586 --> 00:46:47,435
It's going to want to send you backwards, which means then you can't get onto your leading leg.

979
00:46:47,475 --> 00:46:48,678
You end up sweeping.

980
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:55,955
Like things will go through you if you stay forwards and you keep your hands in good positions and you keep your chin forward and shoulders forward and

981
00:46:56,175 --> 00:47:01,969
you can react to the ball in split seconds like you can and you will naturally because your hands will always move quicker than the ball

982
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:04,514
So your hands will move quicker than the ball ever does.

983
00:47:05,857 --> 00:47:07,019
So if you start to trigger,

984
00:47:07,601 --> 00:47:11,156
then your hands can't get to the ball because they're smoothing your body weight.

985
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,852
So then you can't get, as soon as you come into neutral or negative,

986
00:47:15,394 --> 00:47:19,035
then you can't get onto your leading leg you can't literally cannot transfer

987
00:47:19,658 --> 00:47:21,926
So that's hours and hours of work, like hold, hold.

988
00:47:22,368 --> 00:47:24,315
And like the stuff we did with the rebound net,

989
00:47:25,017 --> 00:47:26,038
has helped him with that.

990
00:47:26,098 --> 00:47:28,742
It's like, I'm going to have to hold, I'm going to have to hold, I'm going to have to hold.

991
00:47:28,782 --> 00:47:29,984
And some of the saves that he makes

992
00:47:30,384 --> 00:47:34,870
holding his shakes for a long period of time, and how quickly he can get onto his leading legs through

993
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:36,577
Holding shape, transfer, push.

994
00:47:36,638 --> 00:47:37,764
Holding shape, transfer, push.

995
00:47:38,287 --> 00:47:38,890
Not triggering.

996
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:42,623
it doesn't matter how fast that ball's coming or how hard it's hit or how close it is

997
00:47:43,085 --> 00:47:46,721
you don't if your body weight remains forward and you're not triggering from the pace of the ball

998
00:47:47,223 --> 00:47:48,085
you're going to transfer.

999
00:47:48,305 --> 00:47:50,791
A simple way of saying it is flinching, basically.

1000
00:47:50,811 --> 00:47:52,816
Yeah, but in a big way.

1001
00:47:53,057 --> 00:47:53,999
If you watch that set back,

1002
00:47:53,999 --> 00:47:57,872
Back in the World Cup, no flinching, just like holding, holding, holding.

1003
00:47:58,474 --> 00:48:00,480
To keep your face forward, right?

1004
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,931
When somebody is about to kick a ball from five yards away.

1005
00:48:05,416 --> 00:48:09,289
Natural human reaction is to try and close your eyes and you move your head to the side.

1006
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:10,151
Watch it.

1007
00:48:10,391 --> 00:48:11,652
It is face forward.

1008
00:48:11,812 --> 00:48:14,315
And it is, if this comes right in my face, I'm going to watch it.

1009
00:48:15,377 --> 00:48:16,604
So I'm like, you know.

1010
00:48:16,624 --> 00:48:19,179
We used to work a lot on, we've got no, I can't beat you.

1011
00:48:19,501 --> 00:48:20,404
I've got nowhere to go.

1012
00:48:20,846 --> 00:48:23,154
If you hold and you don't trigger, I cannot score.

1013
00:48:23,476 --> 00:48:24,961
You're the best in the world and I can't beat you.

1014
00:48:25,242 --> 00:48:26,548
I cannot beat you, I cannot beat you.

1015
00:48:27,151 --> 00:48:28,195
I used to say it all the time.

1016
00:48:28,817 --> 00:48:33,709
Even now that I'm working with deflection nets, there's a new way that I've found.

1017
00:48:34,632 --> 00:48:35,514
You know the medicine balls?

1018
00:48:35,975 --> 00:48:36,415
In the gym.

1019
00:48:37,898 --> 00:48:41,404
I put, you know those poles, when you put poles to run?

1020
00:48:41,665 --> 00:48:42,279
Yeah.

1021
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:46,334
I put three poles and the medicine bowl on the top in between.

1022
00:48:47,296 --> 00:48:50,347
So it's kind of like when you're standing, you can't see the ball.

1023
00:48:50,467 --> 00:48:51,451
So you need to go down.

1024
00:48:52,153 --> 00:48:56,262
and look it, or you go high and you, mate, try it, it's perfect.

1025
00:48:57,064 --> 00:49:01,139
Go in goal, Ben, put three poles, you know, the running poles, the one you've got zigzag.

1026
00:49:01,702 --> 00:49:05,658
and put the medicine ball in the middle and go in goal.

1027
00:49:05,939 --> 00:49:06,960
Put two or three.

1028
00:49:07,264 --> 00:49:08,187
Just to try and see the ball.

1029
00:49:08,207 --> 00:49:09,190
Just to try and see the ball.

1030
00:49:09,231 --> 00:49:09,953
He's great.

1031
00:49:11,678 --> 00:49:13,322
And you know who helped me, John, the physio.

1032
00:49:13,924 --> 00:49:18,014
I remember I had a hamstring injury, so I trained a few days with him, I thought,

1033
00:49:18,535 --> 00:49:19,981
man, this is great for goalkeeping.

1034
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,527
So I put in the...

1035
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:26,995
But sometimes I put it 10 yards and then I start, you know, I like to catch balls every time.

1036
00:49:27,055 --> 00:49:28,257
Catch, catch, catch, catch up.

1037
00:49:29,058 --> 00:49:29,939
So I was catching balls.

1038
00:49:29,999 --> 00:49:32,163
I said, no, no, bring it six meters now.

1039
00:49:32,704 --> 00:49:34,427
And then I'm pushing it.

1040
00:49:35,128 --> 00:49:36,272
Now four meters.

1041
00:49:36,332 --> 00:49:37,535
Goals, goals, goals.

1042
00:49:38,698 --> 00:49:41,884
And I'm working on four meters because I'm catching on eight.

1043
00:49:42,686 --> 00:49:45,516
I'm pushing away in six, four goals.

1044
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:48,940
by two weeks, I'm saving the one for me.

1045
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:49,784
You're unlocking the next.

1046
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:52,470
level then you go to three and then two it's like video games

1047
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:56,740
 exactly I use it that way so I find a new way now it's like a new toy for me oh shit

1048
00:49:57,461 --> 00:50:03,034
if anybody had any doubts whether goalkeepers are a different breed honestly this is this is it in a nutshell isn't it this is

1049
00:50:03,415 --> 00:50:08,315
I honestly think that if outfielders had the same kind of interest in their craft

1050
00:50:08,956 --> 00:50:15,592
the same dedication to the craft of stopping the ball going in the back of the net, you'd have 11 Lionel Messi's on the pitch every night.

1051
00:50:15,592 --> 00:50:16,655
every Saturday afternoon, wouldn't you?

1052
00:50:16,735 --> 00:50:17,436
It's as simple as that.

1053
00:50:17,557 --> 00:50:17,957
That's important.

1054
00:50:17,978 --> 00:50:21,385
I think you spoke about John Whitney, who's a sports scientist, strength and conditioning coach.

1055
00:50:22,668 --> 00:50:28,490
mainly outfield, but with such an in-depth knowledge of the biomechanics or biomechanical movement

1056
00:50:29,131 --> 00:50:34,559
That he can help you a lot couldn't he probably helped you a lot with India within your physio and your rehab like and

1057
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:37,909
If you've got that in-depth knowledge of biomechanics and how goalkeepers move, huge.

1058
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:39,071
Right then, mate.

1059
00:50:39,111 --> 00:50:40,152
So you've made the save.

1060
00:50:40,192 --> 00:50:40,993
Full-time whistle's gone.

1061
00:50:41,013 --> 00:50:42,134
Penalty shootout, okay?

1062
00:50:42,434 --> 00:50:45,037
This is... We were watching it, wasn't we?

1063
00:50:45,499 --> 00:50:48,195
And we knew what was gonna happen.

1064
00:50:48,275 --> 00:50:48,919
It was inevitable.

1065
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:52,509
and this is no slight on Hugo Lloris, but

1066
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:57,496
when you put Hugo Lloris in goal and then you put you in goal, the size difference is just phenomenal.

1067
00:50:58,538 --> 00:51:00,885
so sort of daunting and you just failed the goal.

1068
00:51:01,085 --> 00:51:02,088
I don't think it's size though, is it?

1069
00:51:03,111 --> 00:51:03,733
What do you think it is?

1070
00:51:04,195 --> 00:51:05,659
I think it's personality.

1071
00:51:06,001 --> 00:51:06,442
Aura.

1072
00:51:06,643 --> 00:51:06,883
Aura.

1073
00:51:07,184 --> 00:51:08,188
I think it's, again, it's,

1074
00:51:08,629 --> 00:51:10,740
It boils down to confidence to the point of arrogance.

1075
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:12,851
You see the look on the face and the way you hold yourself.

1076
00:51:13,533 --> 00:51:14,895
Small goalies can strip well, yeah?

1077
00:51:15,295 --> 00:51:19,019
Like you've got some small goalies that you think are big on the pitch when they're quite small.

1078
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,605
And some goalies that are big and look small.

1079
00:51:21,926 --> 00:51:25,597
The big ones that look small in the goal and come off the pitch and go, yeah, actually quite big.

1080
00:51:25,637 --> 00:51:26,379
Yeah, it's true, yeah.

1081
00:51:26,539 --> 00:51:30,578
And it's like, it's what you bring in terms of your personality.

1082
00:51:30,598 --> 00:51:30,678
Yeah.

1083
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:36,884
it's like the um we went to man united away and the ronaldo thing remember it yeah yeah

1084
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:39,312
And who was it who missed the penalty?

1085
00:51:39,433 --> 00:51:39,734
Bruno.

1086
00:51:39,754 --> 00:51:40,256
Bruno.

1087
00:51:40,557 --> 00:51:41,742
And we spoke about it before, didn't we?

1088
00:51:41,762 --> 00:51:42,485
What, what, what?

1089
00:51:42,605 --> 00:51:47,697
What little details can you bring into your game that's going to make you this person?

1090
00:51:47,998 --> 00:51:49,141
And it has to be that.

1091
00:51:50,345 --> 00:51:51,107
personality.

1092
00:51:51,569 --> 00:51:55,242
You've got to bring an aura, a personality, a real like.

1093
00:51:55,944 --> 00:51:56,787
I'm not going to get beat.

1094
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:59,336
Whereas it's not down to size.

1095
00:51:59,717 --> 00:52:00,400
It's your presence.

1096
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:02,405
We said that when we were watching the game.

1097
00:52:02,506 --> 00:52:03,488
We actually said that

1098
00:52:04,191 --> 00:52:05,578
And he's making the goal look small.

1099
00:52:05,719 --> 00:52:05,940
Yeah.

1100
00:52:06,342 --> 00:52:07,890
And like you were saying earlier on, cuts about...

1101
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:10,618
how you conduct yourself, you know, shoulders back.

1102
00:52:10,698 --> 00:52:11,741
It's that aura, isn't it?

1103
00:52:11,801 --> 00:52:12,723
Making yourself big.

1104
00:52:12,984 --> 00:52:13,405
Bigger.

1105
00:52:13,525 --> 00:52:16,088
You know, he'd look in his eyes and go, he's saving it.

1106
00:52:16,729 --> 00:52:17,469
It's not because he's big.

1107
00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:17,930
Yeah.

1108
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:18,411
It's just like...

1109
00:52:19,051 --> 00:52:19,592
Yeah.

1110
00:52:19,872 --> 00:52:22,175
Even I suppose it's a lanky after getting to you.

1111
00:52:22,315 --> 00:52:23,217
Why do you put it so high?

1112
00:52:23,237 --> 00:52:24,498
I've never seen you put in that high.

1113
00:52:24,538 --> 00:52:24,899
So may

1114
00:52:25,379 --> 00:52:28,805
i don't know where to go you you made it i have to go really yeah

1115
00:52:28,945 --> 00:52:32,313
I actually asked Solanki, I said, it's a great pen, but why do you go so high?

1116
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:36,088
We watch penalties, so you never go that high.

1117
00:52:36,811 --> 00:52:38,694
I said, mate, I have to change something.

1118
00:52:38,775 --> 00:52:39,576
I have to go there.

1119
00:52:40,017 --> 00:52:41,580
Because he knows you'll save it otherwise.

1120
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:42,542
Yeah, that's fascinating.

1121
00:52:43,063 --> 00:52:44,847
You know, you can get there to the side.

1122
00:52:45,067 --> 00:52:47,673
I know you can get to the side, so I have to put a right in the corner.

1123
00:52:47,773 --> 00:52:52,319
This is what this, that, that I will only back myself up a little bit and say, when I say about size, right?

1124
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:53,221
Some of the penalties,

1125
00:52:53,642 --> 00:52:55,126
you are nearly touching the post.

1126
00:52:55,668 --> 00:52:58,156
By the time you finish a sable, when you get your hand on the ball,

1127
00:52:58,416 --> 00:52:59,520
you're nearly on the post.

1128
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:00,483
That's not size, is it?

1129
00:53:00,763 --> 00:53:01,666
It's got to be size.

1130
00:53:01,726 --> 00:53:02,007
No.

1131
00:53:02,208 --> 00:53:02,669
What is it?

1132
00:53:03,411 --> 00:53:06,644
speed power push and power you don't have to yeah

1133
00:53:06,644 --> 00:53:09,639
 i think i believe that is power and timing yeah

1134
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:11,170
Timing.

1135
00:53:12,826 --> 00:53:14,009
I'm all over this.

1136
00:53:14,109 --> 00:53:16,956
I'm not saying, I always say if you get the timing right,

1137
00:53:18,095 --> 00:53:20,102
I'll reach a post just the timing 

1138
00:53:20,102 --> 00:53:21,222
if you're going to save a penalty you don't

1139
00:53:21,607 --> 00:53:22,671
go to the ball, dear.

1140
00:53:22,691 --> 00:53:23,854
To be fair, anyone can save a penalty.

1141
00:53:23,875 --> 00:53:27,346
Go through the ball, go past the ball, his speed and his power, how quick he can go from here to there.

1142
00:53:28,008 --> 00:53:28,188
Right?

1143
00:53:28,409 --> 00:53:29,451
And it has to be like, boom.

1144
00:53:29,792 --> 00:53:31,035
So it's timing and speed and power.

1145
00:53:31,757 --> 00:53:34,383
Speed equals distance divided by... How quickly you can transfer your body weight, isn't it?

1146
00:53:35,005 --> 00:53:37,114
how quickly you can get onto your leading leg.

1147
00:53:37,134 --> 00:53:38,058
I've got to ask you, Emi,

1148
00:53:38,659 --> 00:53:43,566
Some of the viewers might think this is a strange question, but we've had professor Steve Peters on psychologists on

1149
00:53:43,846 --> 00:53:45,551
And they talk about the gold medal syndrome.

1150
00:53:45,591 --> 00:53:48,238
Now, World Cup's the biggest prize you can win.

1151
00:53:48,339 --> 00:53:49,903
Did you have a moment where you had that...

1152
00:53:50,444 --> 00:53:54,351
gold medal syndrome where you almost had a low after or not.

1153
00:53:55,073 --> 00:53:55,334
No.

1154
00:53:55,655 --> 00:53:56,498
Not just high.

1155
00:53:56,539 --> 00:53:57,402
Always high, yeah.

1156
00:53:58,024 --> 00:53:58,245
But...

1157
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:03,555
After the shoot, after the World Cup, when I was home, I said,

1158
00:54:04,317 --> 00:54:09,126
i reached my dream i can't go any higher because the feeling i had after that work up is like

1159
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:13,332
Even if I win the next one, I already know what I felt.

1160
00:54:14,153 --> 00:54:15,495
So now what's next?

1161
00:54:15,895 --> 00:54:18,218
When you win the Golden Glove in the Copa America,

1162
00:54:18,738 --> 00:54:21,301
You win the Super Cup, you win the Golden Glove and the World Cup.

1163
00:54:21,862 --> 00:54:23,083
It's like, what else can I win?

1164
00:54:23,805 --> 00:54:28,133
Like, if you win the best on Yashin, which I won, it's just individual, you know.

1165
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:32,001
I wanted the World Cup since I was five years old.

1166
00:54:32,442 --> 00:54:34,186
My boy is obsessed with the World Cup.

1167
00:54:34,527 --> 00:54:35,309
That's why I wanted to win.

1168
00:54:36,311 --> 00:54:39,479
But now that's when the psychology comes.

1169
00:54:40,802 --> 00:54:41,585
What's next?

1170
00:54:41,585 --> 00:54:44,935
How can I be motivated when I already reached my dreams?

1171
00:54:45,296 --> 00:54:46,941
It kind of answers my question.

1172
00:54:46,981 --> 00:54:49,949
Like I said, maybe I positioned it incorrectly and low, but...

1173
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:51,653
I always find a way.

1174
00:54:52,114 --> 00:54:55,600
I want to get Aston Villa in the Champions League.

1175
00:54:56,303 --> 00:54:57,267
I was upset with it.

1176
00:54:57,307 --> 00:54:59,659
I was like, I need to get this club because he...

1177
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:05,834
I won the World Cup after 38 years in Argentina, won the Copa America after 30 years,

1178
00:55:06,535 --> 00:55:08,518
We never beat Brazil in the Maracanã.

1179
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:12,903
The first game that they lost in qualifiers in history was against us.

1180
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:16,357
in December, so I always find leader target like

1181
00:55:16,739 --> 00:55:22,417
huge target because let's say you play for Man United you qualify you make top four it's

1182
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:25,104
You know, it's a big season.

1183
00:55:25,224 --> 00:55:29,655
Even if he's starting on with Chelsea, it's more or less anyone can do it or, you know, it's a big club.

1184
00:55:30,358 --> 00:55:32,432
Aston Villa 42 years I said what if

1185
00:55:33,558 --> 00:55:34,020
I can do it.

1186
00:55:34,401 --> 00:55:35,925
What if we're done?

1187
00:55:35,945 --> 00:55:36,828
It's something like...

1188
00:55:37,469 --> 00:55:40,954
it's hard to do special it's it's that's me it's challenging myself

1189
00:55:41,455 --> 00:55:44,142
That's the equivalent of Man City winning the league, isn't it?

1190
00:55:44,223 --> 00:55:45,567
Really, let's be honest.

1191
00:55:45,707 --> 00:55:47,171
Villa getting in the Champions League is...

1192
00:55:47,713 --> 00:55:47,993
It's huge.

1193
00:55:48,013 --> 00:55:49,617
It's absolutely monumental.

1194
00:55:49,757 --> 00:55:52,564
And for me, and I say that to my mum, I say that to my agents,

1195
00:55:54,308 --> 00:55:57,054
It means more staying in a club like Villa

1196
00:55:57,616 --> 00:56:00,186
and deliver what I was dreaming.

1197
00:56:00,528 --> 00:56:02,234
It's like winning a title with Argentina.

1198
00:56:02,877 --> 00:56:03,419
So what next?

1199
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,111
You've got to win the Champions League then because you've ticked everything else off, haven't you?

1200
00:56:06,131 --> 00:56:07,577
Well, it's a title next week.

1201
00:56:08,361 --> 00:56:08,923
I like that.

1202
00:56:09,024 --> 00:56:10,711
Yeah, that's that's next.

1203
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:11,012
All right.

1204
00:56:11,032 --> 00:56:11,695
Can I take you back to the

1205
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:12,578
penalties then, okay?

1206
00:56:12,598 --> 00:56:15,627
So this is where the programme notes start to come into their own, Emi, all right?

1207
00:56:16,068 --> 00:56:19,695
Was you aware, by the way, before the penalty shootout started that you were going to kind of

1208
00:56:20,376 --> 00:56:22,103
Just do a little bit of theatrics.

1209
00:56:22,144 --> 00:56:24,574
Just try and get in the head of the French players a little bit.

1210
00:56:25,376 --> 00:56:31,606
Yeah, obviously I spoke with the psychologist about it because when you're controlling the game,

1211
00:56:32,831 --> 00:56:35,526
you concede three goals is like well at

1212
00:56:35,707 --> 00:56:37,234
I didn't really have a good game there.

1213
00:56:37,314 --> 00:56:39,263
Three goals conceded in five shots.

1214
00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:43,281
made a good save at the end, but that was it really.

1215
00:56:44,044 --> 00:56:48,508
When I go into a shootout, it's like I bring my boy into the playground.

1216
00:56:49,389 --> 00:56:51,473
You know, he's crying in the car.

1217
00:56:51,514 --> 00:56:52,355
Oh, Santi playground.

1218
00:56:53,297 --> 00:56:55,929
And actually, I feel like I dominate that area.

1219
00:56:56,893 --> 00:57:00,047
I can lose, win, or I can save one or not.

1220
00:57:01,031 --> 00:57:04,568
If you watch me, I went straight into the goal.

1221
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:10,600
Even I had a shootout as well the other day and I went into the goal like, this is my zone, I need to control it, you know.

1222
00:57:11,482 --> 00:57:14,152
And then obviously I like to watch goalie.

1223
00:57:14,172 --> 00:57:15,176
I watch a lot of football.

1224
00:57:15,256 --> 00:57:16,320
I watch football every day.

1225
00:57:17,023 --> 00:57:19,895
And then I seen Lloris so many years in the Premier League.

1226
00:57:19,976 --> 00:57:20,458
I know how...

1227
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,587
what he brings to the table.

1228
00:57:22,608 --> 00:57:23,813
He's a really good goalie, but

1229
00:57:24,396 --> 00:57:26,226
In that time, it's like it's me against him.

1230
00:57:26,387 --> 00:57:27,614
It's not me against Mpappe.

1231
00:57:28,558 --> 00:57:30,625
You know, people say, no, you in the head.

1232
00:57:31,146 --> 00:57:31,808
I'm in my head.

1233
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:33,553
It's me against Lloris.

1234
00:57:34,657 --> 00:57:39,215
Is Messi against Mbappe or is, I don't know, Otamendi against Konati?

1235
00:57:39,936 --> 00:57:40,777
It's me against Lloris.

1236
00:57:40,897 --> 00:57:42,799
And I knew that fact at that moment.

1237
00:57:42,979 --> 00:57:44,941
Maybe he got more experience than me.

1238
00:57:45,081 --> 00:57:46,062
Maybe he played more games.

1239
00:57:46,965 --> 00:57:49,477
But I fall in that moment, I'm way better than you.

1240
00:57:51,105 --> 00:57:53,091
She's in that different game, which is shootout.

1241
00:57:53,733 --> 00:57:55,058
So that's when I come.

1242
00:57:55,238 --> 00:57:56,141
If I beat Lloris...

1243
00:57:56,543 --> 00:57:59,095
I got a big chance to win the World Cup.

1244
00:57:59,357 --> 00:57:59,859
It's like...

1245
00:58:01,083 --> 00:58:04,086
when it goes to penalties, it's almost like, right, it's Emi's time now.

1246
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:04,627
It's a different game.

1247
00:58:04,687 --> 00:58:05,648
It's my house now.

1248
00:58:05,888 --> 00:58:06,812
This is it.

1249
00:58:06,832 --> 00:58:08,117
And that's how it goes down, isn't it?

1250
00:58:08,157 --> 00:58:08,639
Yeah, it is.

1251
00:58:09,462 --> 00:58:10,566
All right then, the first penalty.

1252
00:58:12,473 --> 00:58:13,315
Mbappe.

1253
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:16,342
Top hand, nearly.

1254
00:58:16,964 --> 00:58:17,365
Nearly.

1255
00:58:17,425 --> 00:58:19,251
Were you disappointed with the first penalty?

1256
00:58:19,827 --> 00:58:22,016
Yeah, can we talk about timing in the goalkeeping?

1257
00:58:22,036 --> 00:58:24,224
Timing, get it at night, obviously...

1258
00:58:24,745 --> 00:58:29,590
Messi spoke about it and he does two, three steps and goes straight into the ball.

1259
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:30,050
So I was...

1260
00:58:31,092 --> 00:58:32,755
By the time he's shooting, I'm still skipping.

1261
00:58:33,357 --> 00:58:35,561
Maybe she's gone a little bit earlier.

1262
00:58:35,982 --> 00:58:39,266
And then because I concede already too, I knew he was going right.

1263
00:58:39,747 --> 00:58:41,770
I knew, I definitely knew he was going right.

1264
00:58:42,411 --> 00:58:44,937
But then I thought, why did I not go a little bit early?

1265
00:58:46,053 --> 00:58:48,940
And then I went low rather than high, mid-high.

1266
00:58:49,327 --> 00:58:51,632
And I knew that he likes mid-high.

1267
00:58:54,297 --> 00:58:57,200
Shit, you know, I got it wrong, got it all wrong.

1268
00:58:57,782 --> 00:59:00,555
got it all wrong because for me that's a comfortable safe.

1269
00:59:00,595 --> 00:59:01,780
So, but at the end,

1270
00:59:02,704 --> 00:59:04,409
I didn't think, oh, it's not my day.

1271
00:59:04,429 --> 00:59:05,292
I can't say one.

1272
00:59:05,352 --> 00:59:07,017
I just went, if I say two...

1273
00:59:08,462 --> 00:59:10,330
It's coming, it's coming.

1274
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:11,254
One's going to come in a minute.

1275
00:59:11,655 --> 00:59:15,181
When you were watching this Cuts on Holiday, you were at this point just a bag of nerves.

1276
00:59:16,924 --> 00:59:18,126
You probably should have said that.

1277
00:59:19,147 --> 00:59:19,828
He would have said that.

1278
00:59:19,868 --> 00:59:21,711
That's why I said it, because I know that's what he would have said.

1279
00:59:22,453 --> 00:59:26,470
Yeah, it's difficult because you're so far away and all you want to do is for him to win.

1280
00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:27,233
It's like...

1281
00:59:27,916 --> 00:59:30,306
You can't scream at the telly and say, you should have saved that, all right?

1282
00:59:30,507 --> 00:59:31,230
What are you doing?

1283
00:59:31,591 --> 00:59:31,912
Yeah.

1284
00:59:32,173 --> 00:59:32,736
No, not quite.

1285
00:59:32,756 --> 00:59:35,486
I'm just like desperate for him to win.

1286
00:59:37,133 --> 00:59:39,824
Okay, so then Messi takes the next penalty.

1287
00:59:40,909 --> 00:59:42,660
Excuse my language, it's a piss take of a penalty.

1288
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,170
It is a piss take of a penalty, right?

1289
00:59:44,972 --> 00:59:49,478
I talk about then how Lloris do, you know, how he behaves.

1290
00:59:49,538 --> 00:59:51,040
I said, if you stop, you're going to score.

1291
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:56,953
Because I remember Jorginho against him in the Premier League.

1292
00:59:57,254 --> 00:59:59,801
I think Vardy stopped as well against him.

1293
00:59:59,821 --> 01:00:00,743
He went way too early.

1294
01:00:00,783 --> 01:00:02,508
So I said, Leo, just stop and go.

1295
01:00:03,451 --> 01:00:04,012
He will move.

1296
01:00:04,253 --> 01:00:05,998
He moves to his left.

1297
01:00:06,259 --> 01:00:08,846
He rolls it not far off the centre of it.

1298
01:00:08,966 --> 01:00:10,304
In a World Cup final.

1299
01:00:10,311 --> 01:00:11,495
He won't stay in the middle.

1300
01:00:11,696 --> 01:00:13,222
Lloris will never stay in the middle.

1301
01:00:13,744 --> 01:00:17,762
So it's kind of like when I talk to my teammates in the national team, they listen as well.

1302
01:00:18,827 --> 01:00:21,800
i said go to the middle go in the middle go one at least one in the middle

1303
01:00:22,522 --> 01:00:26,073
So we scored two out of five because I was through the middle.

1304
01:00:27,638 --> 01:00:30,191
And then Kingsley Coman steps up.

1305
01:00:31,095 --> 01:00:33,281
Big save, comfortable save.

1306
01:00:33,742 --> 01:00:36,949
When you dive in that way, and it almost hits you in the chest, doesn't it?

1307
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:37,952
It does hit you in the chest, yeah.

1308
01:00:38,192 --> 01:00:43,978
I missed it are you you just know you're saving it though don't you because you've already you're so you almost drive past it don't you

1309
01:00:44,238 --> 01:00:49,932
yeah but you know i i watched penalties the day before and i watched griezmann

1310
01:00:50,614 --> 01:00:55,866
jerut empape baran and afimwani

1311
01:00:56,968 --> 01:00:59,815
So then Griezmann wasn't on the pitch.

1312
01:00:59,835 --> 01:01:01,138
Giroud wasn't on the pitch.

1313
01:01:01,299 --> 01:01:03,424
Dembele wasn't on the pitch, I looked.

1314
01:01:04,448 --> 01:01:05,473
Baran wasn't on the pitch.

1315
01:01:06,116 --> 01:01:08,468
So for the in-comer, I said, I don't know where he's going.

1316
01:01:08,649 --> 01:01:14,027
So that's when it comes, you know, that intuition that I always believe that I back myself up.

1317
01:01:14,208 --> 01:01:15,211
So it's about timing.

1318
01:01:15,852 --> 01:01:19,617
And that's when I got a really, really, I'll say I jumped more than I should have.

1319
01:01:20,338 --> 01:01:24,628
It's more just, you know, I was probably so nervous.

1320
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:28,702
Not so nervous, but so tense that I missed the ball and it hit my chest.

1321
01:01:30,568 --> 01:01:35,183
And that feeling, the way I was jumping, if he goes, yeah, that's me, that's me, I got it right, you know.

1322
01:01:35,625 --> 01:01:40,116
I didn't because I was so frustrated for before for not saving them puppies.

1323
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:42,971
for that's more like me, you know?

1324
01:01:43,092 --> 01:01:43,294
Yeah.

1325
01:01:44,782 --> 01:01:45,843
That I find interesting.

1326
01:01:45,863 --> 01:01:48,806
You know where he says about that tense feeling, that nerve, it's not nerve feeling.

1327
01:01:48,846 --> 01:01:50,327
It's like, it's so much energy.

1328
01:01:51,370 --> 01:01:56,626
isn't it it's so well it's hard to describe that you almost can't feel your fingers

1329
01:01:56,806 --> 01:01:57,768
What, adrenaline?

1330
01:01:58,249 --> 01:01:59,112
Crazy.

1331
01:01:59,712 --> 01:02:02,657
Concentration or I don't know what that is, but it's just...

1332
01:02:04,301 --> 01:02:06,106
You know goalies having cramps.

1333
01:02:06,447 --> 01:02:07,630
How can a goalie have a cramp?

1334
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:12,515
It's because you're so tense, you're so nervous that your muscle contracts, isn't it?

1335
01:02:12,535 --> 01:02:13,516
Yeah, that's right.

1336
01:02:15,585 --> 01:02:17,533
It was a comfortable save in the end.

1337
01:02:18,837 --> 01:02:21,202
I want to talk about the Cermény penalty though.

1338
01:02:21,302 --> 01:02:23,686
So third penalty for France, he drags it wide.

1339
01:02:24,651 --> 01:02:28,030
But this is where, and we're going to talk about shithousery in a minute if that's okay.

1340
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:30,977
But this is where you came into your own a little bit.

1341
01:02:31,017 --> 01:02:31,839
I was buzzing off it.

1342
01:02:31,879 --> 01:02:33,763
I think it's a fair play if you can do it.

1343
01:02:34,385 --> 01:02:37,372
do it all day long you throw the ball away a little bit

1344
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:41,607
And the bit that I really like about this and we talked about it a minute ago is

1345
01:02:42,149 --> 01:02:45,177
Um, the camera sort of pans to Tiumeni's face and he,

1346
01:02:45,458 --> 01:02:46,723
And he's trying to act all cool.

1347
01:02:46,843 --> 01:02:48,188
Like, I'm not fazed by this.

1348
01:02:48,208 --> 01:02:49,352
This ain't even a thing, all right?

1349
01:02:49,813 --> 01:02:50,556
And he has this little...

1350
01:02:51,219 --> 01:02:54,654
double nervous grin honestly it's so double nervous it's ridiculous right

1351
01:02:54,935 --> 01:02:57,318
And I'm thinking, oh, mate, I don't like the look of that.

1352
01:02:57,618 --> 01:03:00,301
Then the camera pans to Didier Deschamps on the sidelines.

1353
01:03:00,541 --> 01:03:04,729
and he's fuming it yeah he's like effing and jeffing and cussing and all that kind of stuff

1354
01:03:05,231 --> 01:03:06,918
And it comes back to Tumeni.

1355
01:03:07,179 --> 01:03:09,509
He steps up to take the penalty and it's inevitable.

1356
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:10,011
Isn't it?

1357
01:03:10,131 --> 01:03:11,694
It is inevitable what he's going to do.

1358
01:03:11,734 --> 01:03:13,218
You know, I'll come to you because.

1359
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:14,682
You know he's going to drag it, don't you?

1360
01:03:14,862 --> 01:03:16,266
Yeah, and it is one of them.

1361
01:03:16,286 --> 01:03:16,868
You can see it.

1362
01:03:16,988 --> 01:03:17,851
You can see it on his face.

1363
01:03:17,871 --> 01:03:19,676
You're like, oh, he's not quite sure, this boy.

1364
01:03:20,418 --> 01:03:23,349
And then that's when you know you've got one over straight away.

1365
01:03:23,429 --> 01:03:24,673
It's like, I've got him.

1366
01:03:24,934 --> 01:03:25,536
Like, I've got him.

1367
01:03:26,861 --> 01:03:31,436
But I knew it was the time because I'm never doing the first pen or the second one.

1368
01:03:32,137 --> 01:03:34,860
It's when I got a big chance that we can win it.

1369
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:38,102
So I saved, I nearly got in pappers against the side.

1370
01:03:38,823 --> 01:03:39,705
I got a second one.

1371
01:03:40,125 --> 01:03:41,868
So I'm thinking when I

1372
01:03:43,193 --> 01:03:46,127
When I look at the young lad coming, it's like, if he missed that pen...

1373
01:03:48,292 --> 01:03:50,698
they might be losing this World Cup.

1374
01:03:50,818 --> 01:03:52,722
So I thought, that's when, what am I doing?

1375
01:03:53,524 --> 01:03:55,650
I said, he needs to go and get it further up.

1376
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,094
You know, he needs it further up.

1377
01:03:57,134 --> 01:03:58,398
I need to do something, you know.

1378
01:03:58,538 --> 01:03:59,601
That's personality, isn't it?

1379
01:03:59,821 --> 01:04:00,394
And the ref was like...

1380
01:04:00,394 --> 01:04:01,865
 Pure personality and presence.

1381
01:04:01,925 --> 01:04:04,149
The ref didn't know what to do, you know, I felt like, no.

1382
01:04:04,349 --> 01:04:06,192
I just keep walking, you know, I just keep walking.

1383
01:04:06,212 --> 01:04:07,474
You threw it just the right.

1384
01:04:07,695 --> 01:04:09,355
Yeah, perfect.

1385
01:04:09,918 --> 01:04:12,206
Because it's hard, you know, when you walk.

1386
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:18,878
yards to take the penalty, how many yards is, I don't know, but in a World Cup final.

1387
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:23,835
You can practice 150 penalties in training and you can put in the top corner.

1388
01:04:23,876 --> 01:04:24,799
Top bins are easy.

1389
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:28,468
And then when you go into a World Cup final behind all Argentinian fans,

1390
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:32,680
They were singing, which that means he will eat you up.

1391
01:04:34,608 --> 01:04:37,120
I'm saying he's going to be feeling something at all.

1392
01:04:37,402 --> 01:04:38,629
I know he played for Real Madrid.

1393
01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:39,977
He'd be feeling something.

1394
01:04:40,238 --> 01:04:41,103
I can see it in his face.

1395
01:04:41,686 --> 01:04:48,176
But then you need to have that luck that you save it or not because otherwise you look like a twat.

1396
01:04:48,642 --> 01:04:54,174
So, and then he, I knew it was going to cross his body shape.

1397
01:04:56,384 --> 01:04:58,074
You know, you've been a goalie, you can see more or less.

1398
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:03,859
you can't really guess by his body shape he can't go he cannot be his foot he was like he's so close

1399
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:06,517
off it's the only place he can go 

1400
01:05:06,517 --> 01:05:10,756
and I thought if he was going in I would definitely save it I feel like something

1401
01:05:11,464 --> 01:05:12,312
You know when you...

1402
01:05:14,784 --> 01:05:18,892
You know, when you don't touch it, but you feel like the air or something in your hands.

1403
01:05:19,232 --> 01:05:19,653
I touch it.

1404
01:05:20,275 --> 01:05:23,346
Yeah, that's why I started dancing because I thought, yeah, I got him.

1405
01:05:24,209 --> 01:05:25,535
So that's what I want to talk about.

1406
01:05:25,575 --> 01:05:27,263
I've got here the horrible shoulder dance.

1407
01:05:27,985 --> 01:05:31,087
I swear my mum's like, I've never, ever done it.

1408
01:05:31,107 --> 01:05:32,649
I can't even move my shoulders nowadays.

1409
01:05:32,729 --> 01:05:34,310
I don't know how I've done it.

1410
01:05:35,031 --> 01:05:37,037
I've never practiced it.

1411
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:38,721
It's so good.

1412
01:05:39,062 --> 01:05:40,406
That just came up in that moment.

1413
01:05:40,466 --> 01:05:41,910
Do you know how many kids are doing that now?

1414
01:05:42,030 --> 01:05:42,812
Oh, I know.

1415
01:05:44,095 --> 01:05:46,621
A friend of ours, we're going to do a podcast with him, and he said,

1416
01:05:48,025 --> 01:05:49,170
our little lad at the weekend.

1417
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:50,443
Doing the whole thing.

1418
01:05:51,158 --> 01:05:52,401
Horrible, it was so horrible.

1419
01:05:52,422 --> 01:05:56,491
We went to Dubai with my wife and my kids and said, and these young lads, you know, on the beach,

1420
01:05:59,844 --> 01:06:00,765
Look what you've done.

1421
01:06:00,806 --> 01:06:01,970
I said, what can I do?

1422
01:06:02,010 --> 01:06:02,512
You know what I mean?

1423
01:06:03,194 --> 01:06:09,669
Another thing I really liked as well then is when Paredes scored his penalty and you kind of sprinted to him, he sprinted to you.

1424
01:06:10,130 --> 01:06:13,143
And that unity of you two, it's like...

1425
01:06:13,404 --> 01:06:14,889
that was your 18-yard box.

1426
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:15,451
You know what I mean?

1427
01:06:15,592 --> 01:06:18,683
It was like it was... That whole area was just Argentine.

1428
01:06:19,888 --> 01:06:24,008
I think the French would have even seen that happening, that little celebration and gone,

1429
01:06:24,571 --> 01:06:25,235
we don't belong here.

1430
01:06:25,436 --> 01:06:26,482
Like they sent ours.

1431
01:06:26,663 --> 01:06:28,070
It was inevitable at that point, wasn't it?

1432
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:32,217
it becomes a habit you know because they're so good at penalties you know because

1433
01:06:32,758 --> 01:06:36,386
 Paredes, oh my God, he can strike Messi, Dybala.

1434
01:06:36,908 --> 01:06:40,736
You got Montiel, never miss a pin, outpaning his career.

1435
01:06:41,197 --> 01:06:41,798
McAllister.

1436
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:47,858
six he was a six taker he got so many takers i thought mate with the takers i got

1437
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:48,983
Di Maria.

1438
01:06:49,003 --> 01:06:49,324
Yeah.

1439
01:06:49,768 --> 01:06:51,631
If I say one or two, that's it.

1440
01:06:51,711 --> 01:06:53,093
And they know that I can save it.

1441
01:06:53,334 --> 01:06:54,255
I've done it every time.

1442
01:06:54,295 --> 01:06:55,397
So I thought, you know, it's a...

1443
01:06:56,079 --> 01:07:00,358
That unity, like you said, once we got to penalties, we win.

1444
01:07:00,619 --> 01:07:01,743
You can win or lose.

1445
01:07:02,627 --> 01:07:04,052
It doesn't mean we're going to win every time.

1446
01:07:04,934 --> 01:07:07,018
I always say the big ones we already done it.

1447
01:07:07,338 --> 01:07:09,682
And when Gonzalo Montiel puts that penalty in,

1448
01:07:11,926 --> 01:07:14,667
The celebration is incredible, but what's it like for him now?

1449
01:07:14,708 --> 01:07:17,850
Because I can only kind of imagine in England, right, if...

1450
01:07:18,471 --> 01:07:19,213
I don't know who it is.

1451
01:07:19,453 --> 01:07:23,623
Somebody, John Stones runs up and scores that winning penalty for England, right?

1452
01:07:23,683 --> 01:07:25,027
He's just done that for Argentina.

1453
01:07:25,368 --> 01:07:26,534
What is he like at home?

1454
01:07:26,674 --> 01:07:27,840
Is he a hero?

1455
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:27,880
Is...

1456
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:28,583
Is he a hero?

1457
01:07:29,246 --> 01:07:33,012
Is the whole team a hero or is there something reserved specially for him?

1458
01:07:33,854 --> 01:07:38,171
You know when you're a young lad, you've got memories, isn't it?

1459
01:07:38,532 --> 01:07:42,383
So every child in Argentina, we remember Montiel.

1460
01:07:43,546 --> 01:07:49,742
like Agüero, you know, and that moment, you know, when you're young, you just, you've got memories, so...

1461
01:07:50,564 --> 01:07:56,378
I think whatever happens in Montiel's career, he will be well known back home forever, you know.

1462
01:07:56,558 --> 01:07:57,983
Forever, forever a legend.

1463
01:07:58,244 --> 01:07:59,969
I loved it when it finished because it was

1464
01:08:00,471 --> 01:08:03,560
No one will remember Paredes penalty in 10 years.

1465
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:04,081
No chance.

1466
01:08:05,605 --> 01:08:12,511
Maybe Messi, Maizé and Montillo, even though he played 10 minutes in the World Cup, in the final.

1467
01:08:12,513 --> 01:08:13,875
really yeah 

1468
01:08:13,875 --> 01:08:18,592
there was two there was two focal points of the celebration wasn't there there was you and there was there was messy

1469
01:08:19,355 --> 01:08:23,228
And then half the team kind of split and it was just, it was absolute chaos, wasn't it?

1470
01:08:23,308 --> 01:08:24,171
There's no fans more

1471
01:08:24,231 --> 01:08:25,272
passionate than Argentina.

1472
01:08:25,312 --> 01:08:25,873
No, no.

1473
01:08:26,174 --> 01:08:27,395
They're like incredible, aren't they?

1474
01:08:27,415 --> 01:08:30,059
I always say to you, come to Argentina to watch me play.

1475
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:30,559
It's just...

1476
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:33,390
I went to Miami tonight just before you went to the World Cup.

1477
01:08:34,535 --> 01:08:36,157
before probably the last camp that you went to.

1478
01:08:36,197 --> 01:08:39,062
In Argentina they choose 60,000 pounds singing and

1479
01:08:39,242 --> 01:08:42,643
jumping and then you just go back placing your tummy and then

1480
01:08:43,146 --> 01:08:47,323
The adrenaline, you know, I never felt pressure before, ever.

1481
01:08:48,367 --> 01:08:52,061
Obviously, when you're young, yes, but when I was older, I never thought coming into a game

1482
01:08:52,803 --> 01:08:56,246
But when I went into the first game of the World Cup.

1483
01:08:56,286 --> 01:08:56,987
Saudi Arabia game.

1484
01:08:57,027 --> 01:08:57,788
Saudi Arabia game.

1485
01:08:58,249 --> 01:09:01,642
And I walk onto the pitch with all the fans screaming in that scenario.

1486
01:09:02,365 --> 01:09:05,450
I felt like a heat inside my body that I'd never felt before, ever.

1487
01:09:06,231 --> 01:09:10,976
And I felt it in the World Cup final going into the warm up.

1488
01:09:11,056 --> 01:09:11,997
Then in the game, I was good.

1489
01:09:12,798 --> 01:09:18,386
But running into my zone, the area, the box with the fans,

1490
01:09:19,228 --> 01:09:23,216
It was like, oh my God, I feel like something I never felt before.

1491
01:09:23,428 --> 01:09:25,553
Even nowadays, playing big games, I never...

1492
01:09:25,861 --> 01:09:26,443
I'm not feeling that.

1493
01:09:26,463 --> 01:09:26,724
What was it?

1494
01:09:26,784 --> 01:09:27,470
Nerves?

1495
01:09:27,486 --> 01:09:28,349
Anxiety?

1496
01:09:28,449 --> 01:09:28,771
Energy?

1497
01:09:29,152 --> 01:09:29,970
Not as...

1498
01:09:29,974 --> 01:09:35,848
You know when you're nervous in a game, you want to go to the toilet maybe, or maybe you go buy flights, you know that?

1499
01:09:36,489 --> 01:09:41,033
feeling in this one which is a heat inside your body like burning inside weird

1500
01:09:41,694 --> 01:09:46,434
that's honestly I knew I was looking forward to it we were looking forward to it but how good was that

1501
01:09:46,936 --> 01:09:47,297
The best.

1502
01:09:47,518 --> 01:09:47,959
The best.

1503
01:09:48,071 --> 01:09:49,034
Emi, you're the man.

1504
01:09:49,134 --> 01:09:50,277
Cutler, you're not bad either.

1505
01:09:51,419 --> 01:09:52,281
It's been The fozCast.

1506
01:09:52,342 --> 01:09:53,023
I hope you enjoyed it.

1507
01:09:53,043 --> 01:09:53,565
We'll see you soon.
