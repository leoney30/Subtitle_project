501
00:24:10,529 --> 00:24:13,033
Like how he walks, how he holds himself, how he speaks.

502
00:24:13,553 --> 00:24:14,635
Like the very best.

503
00:24:14,716 --> 00:24:15,898
I'm the very, very best.

504
00:24:16,018 --> 00:24:17,641
Like, even if he doesn't feel it, he shows it.

505
00:24:17,661 --> 00:24:19,886
Yeah, he was making me believe that I was the best in the league.

506
00:24:20,587 --> 00:24:23,995
Even though I never think that, I never think I'm the best, I'm doing the best season.

507
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:27,022
But he was making me think, you are the best in the league.

508
00:24:27,764 --> 00:24:30,572
Well, how does he do that just constantly telling you constantly?

509
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:33,242
Just remember confidence to the point of arrogance.

510
00:24:33,502 --> 00:24:34,446
So I used to think that.

511
00:24:35,588 --> 00:24:40,113
You're right, I can be arrogant in the way I play, but she's that...

512
00:24:40,554 --> 00:24:42,363
to give me confidence, nothing else.

513
00:24:42,705 --> 00:24:44,675
Not to show everyone, oh, he's arrogant.

514
00:24:45,238 --> 00:24:49,101
It's just to believe yourself that you are the best in the league.

515
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:55,571
And I think if you've catered for most things in training, like match specific, we've covered it all, mate.

516
00:24:56,052 --> 00:24:56,493
You're ready.

517
00:24:57,174 --> 00:24:57,596
You're ready.

518
00:24:57,836 --> 00:24:59,701
Like, nothing can stop you now.

519
00:24:59,741 --> 00:25:00,703
Like, it's the shoulders back.

520
00:25:01,285 --> 00:25:05,255
And it's that, like, training his brain to believe it.

521
00:25:05,335 --> 00:25:07,259
Like, before, when he first came in, it would be more of a...

522
00:25:07,801 --> 00:25:10,791
it'd be more of a, like, Arsenal-Villa at the time or like that.

523
00:25:10,831 --> 00:25:13,781
So he's coming to a team that were completely different for him.

524
00:25:14,222 --> 00:25:18,431
go away with Argentina sometimes and come back and go frustrated.

525
00:25:19,453 --> 00:25:20,795
It's not the level.

526
00:25:20,995 --> 00:25:23,821
And he wouldn't put his shoulders back and go like,

527
00:25:24,751 --> 00:25:28,019
I'm too good for this, he'd go, that's frustrating me and this is frustrating me.

528
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:28,752
I need to get to this.

529
00:25:29,092 --> 00:25:30,195
I need the players to get to that.

530
00:25:30,255 --> 00:25:31,478
I need, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

531
00:25:31,718 --> 00:25:32,839
That's not, that's not your job.

532
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:34,000
You ain't got to worry about that.

533
00:25:34,621 --> 00:25:35,702
You just be the best.

534
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:38,524
Like you just do what you do day in, day out gaming.

535
00:25:38,685 --> 00:25:40,791
game out, the rest will speak for itself.

536
00:25:40,811 --> 00:25:42,777
Did that help you at first when you signed for Villa where

537
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:45,362
You knew you were going to be busy and you were busy, wasn't you?

538
00:25:45,402 --> 00:25:46,403
You're making saves.

539
00:25:46,423 --> 00:25:47,545
You're having to be called on.

540
00:25:47,685 --> 00:25:50,190
in every single game to save Aston Villa, basically.

541
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,574
Did that help sort of raise that confidence as well?

542
00:25:52,814 --> 00:25:53,836
Yeah, it was huge.

543
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:55,459
It was huge.

544
00:25:55,779 --> 00:25:58,163
Normally, Arsenal and a big club, a national team,

545
00:25:58,704 --> 00:26:04,386
you get two shots, but two good ones, 1v1 or a clear shot.

546
00:26:05,216 --> 00:26:11,152
and Avila was just deflection after deflection, crosses, but I thought it was good, I'm reactive.

547
00:26:11,774 --> 00:26:15,810
I'm really good in the air, kicking a lot of balls.

548
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,457
I wasn't used to kick so many balls.

549
00:26:17,757 --> 00:26:18,920
I'm really good kicker of the ball.

550
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,945
So I feel like, oh, if I get all these things right,

551
00:26:22,426 --> 00:26:23,569
I can really help the team.

552
00:26:23,709 --> 00:26:25,133
But then I was going with the national team.

553
00:26:25,754 --> 00:26:27,358
When I was playing for Argentina, I was like,

554
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,181
Made that's so easy.

555
00:26:29,842 --> 00:26:32,126
You know, it was so easy.

556
00:26:32,186 --> 00:26:33,268
Why why is it so much easier?

557
00:26:33,629 --> 00:26:33,809
Why?

558
00:26:33,829 --> 00:26:35,591
Because I was doing so much for the villa.

559
00:26:36,232 --> 00:26:36,733
So much.

560
00:26:36,893 --> 00:26:37,514
Involved in everything.

561
00:26:37,755 --> 00:26:40,547
I made 160 saves I think in the first season.

562
00:26:41,109 --> 00:26:45,022
So when I was going with the national team, making one or two saves, clean sheet, clean sheet, clean sheet.

563
00:26:45,102 --> 00:26:48,266
I think I got like 30 clean sheets in 37 games for my country.

564
00:26:48,916 --> 00:26:50,021
So it was so easy.

565
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:52,510
do you notice the opposition?

566
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:57,688
So when you go away with Argentina, they won't press you so much because they know they're happy to let you have the ball, basically.

567
00:26:57,728 --> 00:26:58,089
Again, that...

568
00:26:58,410 --> 00:26:59,875
Kind of takes the stress off a bit, doesn't it?

569
00:27:00,818 --> 00:27:04,570
The first few games with the national team, the manager did not want me to play from the back.

570
00:27:05,272 --> 00:27:06,094
No, he hated it.

571
00:27:06,555 --> 00:27:10,965
Now in the national team, we play a lot with the back because they also in my team, they watch you every game.

572
00:27:11,687 --> 00:27:13,836
for Aston Villa, so they trust you more.

573
00:27:13,856 --> 00:27:14,640
And in Manchester, it's like,

574
00:27:15,563 --> 00:27:16,507
He went at half-time.

575
00:27:16,547 --> 00:27:17,631
We played Uruguay at home.

576
00:27:17,872 --> 00:27:18,996
He hates playing from the back.

577
00:27:19,016 --> 00:27:20,040
He's that old school manager.

578
00:27:21,204 --> 00:27:26,893
It was me, McAllister, Enzo Fernandez, De Paul playing with Romero.

579
00:27:27,975 --> 00:27:28,998
They're all good footballers.

580
00:27:29,018 --> 00:27:29,580
Yeah, ballers.

581
00:27:29,801 --> 00:27:32,629
So we were doing the 1-2, 1-2 from the back.

582
00:27:32,749 --> 00:27:33,672
If you guys want to play...

583
00:27:34,234 --> 00:27:34,576
You do it.

584
00:27:34,676 --> 00:27:35,439
But I don't like it.

585
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,182
It was a halftime.

586
00:27:36,724 --> 00:27:38,231
And we went, we're going to keep doing it.

587
00:27:39,355 --> 00:27:40,903
So that's a national team.

588
00:27:40,923 --> 00:27:42,972
The level of me is just incredible.

589
00:27:43,735 --> 00:27:44,638
I can imagine.

590
00:27:44,938 --> 00:27:47,164
Let's sort of fast forward with Villa a little bit then.

591
00:27:48,488 --> 00:27:52,201
I think the progression of Villa over the last couple of years in particular has been incredible.

592
00:27:53,886 --> 00:27:58,634
It was probably the catalyst was when Unai Emery came into Aston Villa, took over from Steven Gerrard.

593
00:27:59,896 --> 00:28:00,357
I'm on the sack.

594
00:28:00,757 --> 00:28:01,139
Pardon, sorry?

595
00:28:01,199 --> 00:28:01,782
And I got the sack.

596
00:28:02,003 --> 00:28:03,972
And then you got the sack, unfortunately.

597
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:07,853
um actually that might be an interesting thing to talk about actually is

598
00:28:08,275 --> 00:28:14,514
is how that dynamic works then is because a new manager comes in, he brings his own staff in, cuts, unfortunately gets sacked.

599
00:28:15,496 --> 00:28:20,503
How does that work from a goalie's perspective then when you are expected to just start up with another goalie coach?

600
00:28:21,485 --> 00:28:25,318
I think having the same spot director and the same CEO, I thought he was fine.

601
00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:27,617
I said, no, I can't.

602
00:28:28,028 --> 00:28:29,171
Stay here, we're all for you.

603
00:28:29,231 --> 00:28:30,053
You brought me here.

604
00:28:30,414 --> 00:28:32,180
I'm Argentinian number one.

605
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:34,281
I put my name...

606
00:28:35,308 --> 00:28:39,661
higher obviously in the ranks and I said you'll be fine and then I remember saying like look

607
00:28:40,242 --> 00:28:42,468
I'm getting sacked and it was a big shock for me.

608
00:28:42,508 --> 00:28:43,571
You know what I'm saying?

609
00:28:43,591 --> 00:28:44,975
We knew the relationship we had.

610
00:28:45,658 --> 00:28:48,571
how comfortable I was with him on and off the pitch.

611
00:28:50,277 --> 00:28:54,790
that I went to the club, to the CEO, to the director, and said, there's nothing we can do.

612
00:28:55,152 --> 00:28:58,089
as a manager decision that's a new staff decision and

613
00:28:59,734 --> 00:29:02,721
I knew Javi, so I knew Javi wouldn't do that.

614
00:29:03,602 --> 00:29:08,850
probably meet him, talk to him and then work alongside him because that's how I know Javi.

615
00:29:10,514 --> 00:29:13,041
So it was quite difficult knowing he doesn't have a club.

616
00:29:13,121 --> 00:29:15,487
Obviously, I didn't have that relationship day in, day out.

617
00:29:17,374 --> 00:29:20,144
So it was a difficult period for me last year.

618
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:24,920
because I was going to a World Cup as well, so I couldn't really

619
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:29,017
a lot of changes a lot of changes so it was hard that season was hard for me

620
00:29:29,218 --> 00:29:33,845
And what's that like from your point of view then because I'm guessing that that's probably

621
00:29:34,507 --> 00:29:40,549
one of the biggest sort of worries and scares of being a football coach or a goalie coach, assistant manager, anything like that,

622
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:45,000
If that manager gets sacked, then you're kind of fearing for your job as well.

623
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:45,922
Because it's without...

624
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:47,809
It's not within your control.

625
00:29:48,311 --> 00:29:49,736
How do you not take that personally?

626
00:29:52,626 --> 00:29:58,660
I think you have to when you take the job you feel like it's part and parcel a little bit so when you take the job you know there's a chance of it happening so you have to

627
00:29:58,781 --> 00:30:01,513
put that to the back of your mind and go right okay if it happens it happens

628
00:30:02,537 --> 00:30:05,951
And I'm all about the development of the goalies, right?

629
00:30:06,132 --> 00:30:06,754
I'm all about...

630
00:30:07,537 --> 00:30:11,005
leaving the place better than when I found it.

631
00:30:11,045 --> 00:30:14,172
I'm all about every day, if I get the sack, I get the sack, but I've left it better.

632
00:30:14,392 --> 00:30:15,073
Miles better.

633
00:30:15,093 --> 00:30:17,096
That goalie unit, the whole goalie unit.

634
00:30:17,136 --> 00:30:19,039
That unit is, that department.

635
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,668
is so much better than when I found it and when I took control of it.

636
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:25,292
And I can, like...

637
00:30:25,993 --> 00:30:30,208
I don't know, like when you get the sack and you don't know why you've got the sack, you can't learn, can you?

638
00:30:30,689 --> 00:30:33,720
So it's like somebody who doesn't sat me down and gone, I've sat you because of these reasons.

639
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,864
And you go, right, that's fair enough.

640
00:30:34,985 --> 00:30:35,607
I'll learn from that.

641
00:30:36,329 --> 00:30:37,212
That was the thing for me.

642
00:30:37,232 --> 00:30:41,181
I wanted somebody to sit me down and go, right, you've not done this and you've not done that, and that was poor.

643
00:30:41,722 --> 00:30:43,166
And then you can go away and go, right, that's how it is.

644
00:30:43,246 --> 00:30:43,668
to improve.

645
00:30:43,788 --> 00:30:45,013
But is it not just circumstantial?

646
00:30:45,514 --> 00:30:47,040
You know that deep down you go...

647
00:30:47,722 --> 00:30:54,177
it's because they're bringing in their own literally collateral damage isn't it they're bringing in their own stuff so in the end you just go right okay I've just been sacked and that's it but

648
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,390
to get sacked and then see someone that you've worked with

649
00:30:58,951 --> 00:31:02,080
like so closely win the World Cup was just like,

650
00:31:02,542 --> 00:31:03,284
was everything for me.

651
00:31:03,525 --> 00:31:04,548
It was massive.

652
00:31:04,568 --> 00:31:06,875
All my family, we went on holiday.

653
00:31:07,337 --> 00:31:08,540
We're like, we all watched it together.

654
00:31:08,941 --> 00:31:13,171
He said, I promise you, if you win the World Cup, you give me a FaceTime after the game.

655
00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:15,354
That's what I was going to ask you.

656
00:31:15,394 --> 00:31:18,397
How quickly after you won the World Cup did you... In the changing room.

657
00:31:18,457 --> 00:31:19,158
In the changing room.

658
00:31:19,178 --> 00:31:19,518
Yeah, yeah.

659
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:24,490
But to be fair, the club was good, I promise you.

660
00:31:25,152 --> 00:31:29,087
we gave him a year of his salary, you know, we're going to look after

661
00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:30,815
A couple million quid, I think, wasn't it?

662
00:31:30,835 --> 00:31:31,658
Yeah, three or five.

663
00:31:31,678 --> 00:31:31,899
Lira.

664
00:31:34,128 --> 00:31:37,253
No, the club kept their promise, so that's what it's about.

665
00:31:37,474 --> 00:31:38,155
They're quite good.

666
00:31:39,156 --> 00:31:40,198
And it is, it's one of them, isn't it?

667
00:31:40,479 --> 00:31:44,614
I kind of, when I got, I've never been out football since I was 16, ever.

668
00:31:45,327 --> 00:31:48,182
And I got the sack and I just went, oh, God.

669
00:31:48,202 --> 00:31:49,027
I got a family again, eh?

670
00:31:49,187 --> 00:31:53,499
yeah like you just need that breather it's not until you stop you go oh my god like

671
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,542
I needed that.

672
00:31:54,782 --> 00:31:55,524
I needed the break.

673
00:31:55,564 --> 00:31:57,990
I needed like four or five months of just like calm.

674
00:31:58,431 --> 00:32:02,618
So interesting you say that because Rob Paul Robinson said this exact same thing, didn't they?

675
00:32:02,878 --> 00:32:03,922
He said, from 16 to 38.

676
00:32:04,203 --> 00:32:05,789
That's all you need.

677
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:08,078
Like the pressures of football, you don't realise, like...

678
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:12,691
while you're in it you can't see the woods for the trees like you don't realize the pressure and

679
00:32:13,093 --> 00:32:16,231
and the time it's taken daily like getting in at half seven

680
00:32:16,553 --> 00:32:18,855
You're not leaving until half six, seven o'clock at night.

681
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:19,435
You're going home.

682
00:32:19,475 --> 00:32:19,816
Repeat.

683
00:32:20,116 --> 00:32:20,936
Pressure of winning games.

684
00:32:20,997 --> 00:32:21,737
Pressure of winning games.

685
00:32:21,797 --> 00:32:22,638
Pressure of winning games.

686
00:32:24,481 --> 00:32:28,347
How did you say when you kind of took you you kind of took that breath what I

687
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:30,359
What was your mentality like?

688
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:33,825
Were you, I want to get back in, or let's just take a minute?

689
00:32:33,845 --> 00:32:34,647
Let's just take a minute.

690
00:32:35,348 --> 00:32:35,769
needed it.

691
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,112
I really needed it.

692
00:32:37,312 --> 00:32:41,079
And I had a couple of offers that I thought, I can't, and decent ones.

693
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,141
And I thought, I'm not ready.

694
00:32:43,401 --> 00:32:44,422
Like, I can't do it.

695
00:32:44,982 --> 00:32:45,683
I needed the break.

696
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:47,444
I felt kind of burnt out.

697
00:32:47,544 --> 00:32:47,985
I felt like

698
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:49,547
And it wasn't until I stopped.

699
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:50,609
If I'd have kept going, I'd have been fine.

700
00:32:50,649 --> 00:32:52,712
But I stopped and gone, Jesus, like, I need it.

701
00:32:53,594 --> 00:32:56,081
Did you start to appreciate the things that you missed out?

702
00:32:56,101 --> 00:32:58,769
Because I know when you retired from Watford, Ben, you...

703
00:32:59,471 --> 00:33:03,329
you found pleasure in the small things in life, like having a weekend, going to the Friday night.

704
00:33:04,594 --> 00:33:05,619
Friday night's incredible.

705
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,222
Do you know this?

706
00:33:06,343 --> 00:33:07,288
Friday night's incredible.

707
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:07,911
They...

708
00:33:08,454 --> 00:33:11,088
You can go to the pub and stuff.

709
00:33:11,108 --> 00:33:12,174
You can have a beer and that.

710
00:33:12,435 --> 00:33:19,132
chill you ain't gonna worry about getting up in the morning because the most you see yourself though footballers they kind of get a lot more insular towards the end of the week and

711
00:33:19,272 --> 00:33:21,258
because that stress starts to come on, doesn't it?

712
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:23,203
And it's like, the game's here tomorrow,

713
00:33:23,624 --> 00:33:24,466
You haven't got any of that.

714
00:33:24,486 --> 00:33:25,649
It's incredible, let me be honest.

715
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:26,732
It's incredible.

716
00:33:26,752 --> 00:33:27,494
I don't want to feel it here.

717
00:33:27,614 --> 00:33:28,719
Give me a few more years.

718
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:34,332
I go all in, so they mean everything to me, like everything.

719
00:33:34,632 --> 00:33:36,574
I do whatever it takes to make them better.

720
00:33:37,855 --> 00:33:39,979
all day, every day, constantly in my mind, like, how do I do this?

721
00:33:39,999 --> 00:33:40,700
Where am I going to do this?

722
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,561
How am I going to make him better?

723
00:33:41,581 --> 00:33:42,843
What am I going to do in training?

724
00:33:43,223 --> 00:33:44,386
How are we going to be at the game?

725
00:33:44,426 --> 00:33:46,912
Is what we need to do to implement the game, the following game?

726
00:33:47,113 --> 00:33:48,717
What do we put rightly into the next game?

727
00:33:48,737 --> 00:33:50,020
And it's just like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

728
00:33:50,961 --> 00:33:51,623
And you just need to go.

729
00:33:52,003 --> 00:33:52,424
I've got to say, I...

730
00:33:53,846 --> 00:33:55,872
I've worked with some really good goalie coaches in my time.

731
00:33:56,113 --> 00:33:57,296
I have never seen anybody

732
00:33:57,897 --> 00:34:03,302
take on this goalie department unit and make it their baby like I have seen Neil Cutler do.

733
00:34:03,402 --> 00:34:04,145
It genuinely is.

734
00:34:04,185 --> 00:34:05,229
It's like your baby, isn't it?

735
00:34:05,469 --> 00:34:06,533
It's like the whole thing.

736
00:34:06,573 --> 00:34:09,343
And you're talking goalie coaches underneath of you,

737
00:34:09,704 --> 00:34:14,193
You're talking like academy goalies, young goalies under 12, 34, all the way through.

738
00:34:14,233 --> 00:34:15,615
You're talking a lot of people, aren't you?

739
00:34:15,956 --> 00:34:20,708
And you came in, I remember at West Brom and it was like, yeah, this is all of mine and I will take charge of it.

740
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:22,152
It was good to see, to be fair.

741
00:34:22,793 --> 00:34:26,302
I feel like I've improved as I got older and more knowledgeable.

742
00:34:26,482 --> 00:34:28,687
And since being with them and since...

743
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:33,137
Obviously me going on to what he did even more confidence to take that on and

744
00:34:33,458 --> 00:34:38,112
like even more confidence to implement my ideas and my philosophy and what I think

745
00:34:38,573 --> 00:34:45,025
to other coaches because you do you gain that bit more every step you go a bit more confident a bit more knowledgeable a bit more experienced and then

746
00:34:45,546 --> 00:34:50,085
you feel like you can implement it with more, I don't know, a bit more aggressively.

747
00:34:50,246 --> 00:34:50,748
Authority.

748
00:34:51,029 --> 00:34:52,233
A bit more authority.

749
00:34:52,534 --> 00:34:53,177
It's proven.

750
00:34:53,317 --> 00:34:53,699
It works.

751
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:54,542
Yeah, it's proven.

752
00:34:55,224 --> 00:35:00,861
I mean, like you were saying, with every loan that you get, I know that loan at Katafe that didn't quite work out.

753
00:35:01,162 --> 00:35:04,995
getting sacked, it all just makes, rightly or wrongly, it makes you better, doesn't it?

754
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:06,881
And Xavi's a really good coach, by the way.

755
00:35:07,523 --> 00:35:12,253
he's come on and you've just kept doing that and that's massively important to me like it's not somebody come in and

756
00:35:12,814 --> 00:35:19,260
ripped apart what we've done over those years Javi's come in and gone no we just keep building we just keep getting better and it's just that's massively important

757
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,827
Emi, can we ask and pick your brain?

758
00:35:21,847 --> 00:35:23,712
Because I wasn't aware of this rule.

759
00:35:24,013 --> 00:35:24,534
Kurtz, were you?

760
00:35:25,637 --> 00:35:26,037
Incredible.

761
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:28,463
It's like they just make up rules when they want to, basically.

762
00:35:29,244 --> 00:35:32,270
I want to talk about the Conference League quarterfinal, the penalty shootout.

763
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:33,793
So you've already got a yellow card in the game.

764
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:38,030
And then you get another yellow card in the penalty shootout.

765
00:35:38,994 --> 00:35:43,277
Were you aware that that meant you were going to miss the first leg of the semi-final?

766
00:35:44,158 --> 00:35:45,159
Mate, I was like...

767
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:48,073
You know, it was the game started.

768
00:35:48,093 --> 00:35:50,557
So the fan was having a go at me because I was in France.

769
00:35:50,617 --> 00:35:52,460
Obviously they remember the World Cup final.

770
00:35:52,641 --> 00:35:56,280
So the fans were straight up muted since the start of the game.

771
00:35:56,983 --> 00:36:00,860
And the Reds, the first goal kick, he went, I'm going to book you.

772
00:36:01,261 --> 00:36:03,669
I said, mate, I'm just getting the ball.

773
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:06,517
I was asking the ball for the ball boy.

774
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,753
And because they probably were French, they would not give me the ball.

775
00:36:09,773 --> 00:36:10,717
I had to go and get it.

776
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,862
And he was like, stop wasting time.

777
00:36:13,042 --> 00:36:13,663
I'm going to book you.

778
00:36:14,504 --> 00:36:15,425
First goal kick.

779
00:36:15,445 --> 00:36:15,526
So...

780
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:19,155
I got booked after 25 minutes, never seen before.

781
00:36:19,215 --> 00:36:20,459
Losing 1-0, got booked.

782
00:36:21,382 --> 00:36:21,924
Don't ask me why.

783
00:36:23,689 --> 00:36:26,115
The game was on and the penalty shootout.

784
00:36:26,656 --> 00:36:33,112
So the Red was like straight up going at me because he knew me, probably watched videos about me.

785
00:36:33,894 --> 00:36:36,443
So he knew how I behaved in the penalty shootout.

786
00:36:38,128 --> 00:36:42,281
uh so save the first plane obviously i shoot the crowd because they were having a stick at me at the

787
00:36:42,421 --> 00:36:46,626
Whole games, insulting me, throwing me coins, lighters, the whole game.

788
00:36:48,391 --> 00:36:53,346
But then I see the first band and their players must go into the crowd.

789
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:55,630
So there was no ball on the pitch.

790
00:36:56,331 --> 00:36:59,615
So then I turned and I was asking the ball to the ball boy.

791
00:36:59,955 --> 00:37:04,465
I didn't want my teammate to wait to take the pen because I know the pressure.

792
00:37:06,546 --> 00:37:13,202
are you aware of that now are you fully aware of that now please can you give me the ball and the ref went and she's with the yellow so I'm off

793
00:37:14,525 --> 00:37:18,634
I got a yellow I'm off I said ref I'm asking for the ball and then he was just walking off

794
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:22,536
I thought, am I off or did he gave me the yellow?

795
00:37:22,785 --> 00:37:24,147
Are you thinking, don't say anything?

796
00:37:24,507 --> 00:37:25,048
Get back in goal.

797
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:31,718
And you see all the players from Lille, he's got yellow, he's got yellow.

798
00:37:32,219 --> 00:37:33,323
I said, no, no, no, it's not off.

799
00:37:33,503 --> 00:37:34,686
I know he's got yellow.

800
00:37:34,766 --> 00:37:35,288
He was a ref.

801
00:37:35,569 --> 00:37:37,554
And Douglas was, Dougie, just tell him.

802
00:37:37,995 --> 00:37:42,143
because I was going to be the captain, but I said, Doggy, you just keep the armband.

803
00:37:42,183 --> 00:37:42,564
I don't want it.

804
00:37:43,205 --> 00:37:43,787
for the shooter.

805
00:37:43,848 --> 00:37:46,357
I just want to concentrate on penalties, you know.

806
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:53,343
And then they told me after the game that I missed the semi-final because I got two yellows

807
00:37:53,703 --> 00:37:56,378
in one game, and they say that

808
00:37:58,047 --> 00:38:01,753
When you play in a semi-final, quarter-finals, then you get two yellows.

809
00:38:03,694 --> 00:38:05,036
It doesn't count in shootout.

810
00:38:05,176 --> 00:38:07,177
Shootout is like a different game.

811
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:11,991
I said, how can I be suspended for the first leg in the semi-final?

812
00:38:12,652 --> 00:38:14,817
If the shootout is not part of the leg.

813
00:38:16,581 --> 00:38:23,060
So it worked the same as if you got a yellow card in the first leg and a yellow card in the second leg, you would miss the first leg of the semifinal then?

814
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:23,982
That's how it worked.

815
00:38:24,103 --> 00:38:28,135
No, I had a yellow at Villa Park for time-wasting.

816
00:38:28,496 --> 00:38:32,983
You've got three yellow cards and two... And then I've got a yellow card in the corner.

817
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:37,925
in the second leg but I asked the club he said if I get a yellow card

818
00:38:38,306 --> 00:38:40,191
In France, will I miss the semi-final?

819
00:38:40,211 --> 00:38:42,856
I said, no, with two yellows, you won't miss the semi-final.

820
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:47,204
So I said, okay, so that was, you know, for if we winning,

821
00:38:47,885 --> 00:38:50,331
Late in the game, I would just calm myself down.

822
00:38:50,451 --> 00:38:52,336
Even if I get a yellow, I don't mean the semi-final.

823
00:38:52,817 --> 00:38:53,318
It was checked.

824
00:38:53,478 --> 00:38:53,979
It was all good.

825
00:38:55,282 --> 00:39:01,498
And then when it's three yellows, the UEFA said, what are we doing now?

826
00:39:01,818 --> 00:39:06,288
So they decided at that time, they made the app that couldn't play the semifinals.

827
00:39:06,529 --> 00:39:07,451
Like they punished me.

828
00:39:08,072 --> 00:39:13,959
Have for having three yellows there that I think they might have all sort of looked at you haven't gone There's no way on this earth anybody

829
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,005
can be that much of a shit house, right?

830
00:39:16,446 --> 00:39:19,033
To get three yellow cards in two games, it's impossible, right?

831
00:39:19,455 --> 00:39:22,573
I put all my money that no one knew in football that...

832
00:39:23,818 --> 00:39:26,483
If you get two yellows in one game, you will not get a red card.

833
00:39:27,144 --> 00:39:28,006
No one knew in football.

834
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:32,781
I would just like to say, are you aware now though, you know, that when, if you're playing in a game,

835
00:39:32,941 --> 00:39:37,722
and it goes to a penalty shootout, are you aware that everybody knows exactly how that penalty shootout is going to end?

836
00:39:37,862 --> 00:39:37,983
Yes.

837
00:39:38,123 --> 00:39:38,584
Do you know that?

838
00:39:38,604 --> 00:39:39,827
Even their players.

839
00:39:40,849 --> 00:39:44,177
I remember against Lille, the ball was in between

840
00:39:44,899 --> 00:39:48,370
me and the little player, I can't remember his name.

841
00:39:48,531 --> 00:39:50,779
So I ran into the ball, he was sprinting.

842
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,163
Because he knew me.

843
00:39:53,186 --> 00:39:55,574
And then I got the ball and I left it on the floor like that.

844
00:39:55,774 --> 00:40:00,206
pulled him off already so then when he missed a pen he smashed the ball into the crowd like

845
00:40:01,049 --> 00:40:04,041
really upset for my god I went into his head already

846
00:40:05,708 --> 00:40:06,770
It's so easy now.

847
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:08,052
It's easy.

848
00:40:08,914 --> 00:40:11,940
Mate, and I thought, it's a young lad, Gomez, from Lille.

849
00:40:12,682 --> 00:40:17,392
And I promise you, for my kid, when he was putting the ball on the floor, he was shaking.

850
00:40:17,573 --> 00:40:17,813
Wow.

851
00:40:18,214 --> 00:40:20,962
That's when my mum's life, it was actually shaking so far.

852
00:40:21,363 --> 00:40:24,271
But I already had a yellow, so I thought if you eat a reference,

853
00:40:24,531 --> 00:40:27,117
booked me in the shootout, how can I be off?

854
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,101
So I couldn't do anything.

855
00:40:29,943 --> 00:40:33,692
stupid or what I wanted to do because I already had a yellow in the game.

856
00:40:34,734 --> 00:40:35,195
Incredible.

857
00:40:35,795 --> 00:40:36,276
World class.

858
00:40:36,316 --> 00:40:36,636
Weird.

859
00:40:36,757 --> 00:40:37,457
I'm thinking everything.

860
00:40:37,718 --> 00:40:38,438
Incredible.

861
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:40,020
Shall we do some World Cup chat?

862
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,464
Oh, we've got to do World War II.

863
00:40:41,504 --> 00:40:42,908
Right, this is the bit earlier, right?

864
00:40:42,928 --> 00:40:45,936
When I was prepping for this Emi, I was giggling to myself.

865
00:40:45,956 --> 00:40:46,337
I was like...

866
00:40:46,397 --> 00:40:48,580
Honestly, I was so excited about this.

867
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:48,941
Giddy.

868
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:50,523
Giddy is what I was, right?

869
00:40:50,763 --> 00:40:51,024
Giddy.

870
00:40:52,205 --> 00:40:55,369
We've got to start with... So forget the rest of the game, right?

871
00:40:55,389 --> 00:40:56,670
The rest of the game was incredible.

872
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:57,331
It was fantastic.

873
00:40:57,411 --> 00:40:57,712
It was...

874
00:40:58,252 --> 00:41:03,500
about as good a, not even World Cup fight, as good a game as football as you could wish to watch, wasn't it?

875
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,142
a guarantee playing as well.

876
00:41:05,442 --> 00:41:08,546
It's like it was written by a Hollywood producer or something.

877
00:41:08,586 --> 00:41:09,387
It was phenomenal, right?

878
00:41:09,947 --> 00:41:15,933
I'm going to transport you though to the 122nd minute and 40 seconds, 42 seconds actually.

879
00:41:16,777 --> 00:41:19,890
And Kolo Mwani just gets put through and...

880
00:41:21,416 --> 00:41:26,312
And I want to know now from a goalkeeper's perspective, everything.

881
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:27,835
Absolutely everything.

882
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:31,100
Everything that's going through your mind, cuts I want to know you, technical details,

883
00:41:31,702 --> 00:41:33,841
Everything that's gone on, break it down for me, Emi.

884
00:41:36,366 --> 00:41:39,831
The first thing I always say, I didn't think it was that good, the save.

885
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:40,634
Wow.

886
00:41:40,895 --> 00:41:43,269
I made better saves than that, but...

887
00:41:45,155 --> 00:41:48,842
I expect Otamendi to miss the ball.

888
00:41:49,663 --> 00:41:50,525
You'd already read that.

889
00:41:51,489 --> 00:41:54,442
Look Ben, I was having a comfortable game

890
00:41:54,985 --> 00:42:00,686
you know really comfortable really good with the ball of my feet 75 minutes then i can see two goals or three goals in

891
00:42:01,107 --> 00:42:01,448
Two minutes.

892
00:42:01,468 --> 00:42:06,274
Out of nothing with two penalties and one goal we impacted and maybe I should have a strong hand on it.

893
00:42:08,499 --> 00:42:10,142
And then I was so comfortable,

894
00:42:10,784 --> 00:42:15,439
calm in that situation for, oh no, Otis is going to miss it, Otis is going to miss it, Otis is going to miss it.

895
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:16,363
And then he does it.

896
00:42:16,523 --> 00:42:17,025
So then I'm,

897
00:42:17,667 --> 00:42:20,050
I'm calm because I'm already expecting him to miss it.

898
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:25,763
If I'm not expecting Otamendi to miss a ball, I don't think I'm going to save that ball.

899
00:42:26,666 --> 00:42:29,756
And I'm, you know, I remember the Maria school.

900
00:42:30,077 --> 00:42:34,474
against Brazil in the Maracanã when Edison came out and Di Maria just looped over him.

901
00:42:34,976 --> 00:42:37,909
So if you're running, he's going to loop it.

902
00:42:38,271 --> 00:42:40,014
So Edison was running out towards him.

903
00:42:40,074 --> 00:42:43,480
It was Di Maria and we won the Copa America because Di Maria looped him.

904
00:42:44,121 --> 00:42:44,381
1-1-0.

905
00:42:44,622 --> 00:42:50,431
So I thought, that came into my head, even though it was so close, I said, I'm staying.

906
00:42:50,992 --> 00:42:54,589
And then how the ball was travelling, then I was adjusting to the ball.

907
00:42:56,034 --> 00:42:58,662
Because if I was staying too deep, he had a pass.

908
00:42:59,665 --> 00:43:01,852
He could square the pass into, I think it was in pass.

909
00:43:01,952 --> 00:43:06,278
So I thought, okay, I close the goal, I close the goal, I close the goal.

910
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:09,002
And then because, you know, Ben, you've been a goalkeeper.

911
00:43:09,042 --> 00:43:11,766
So if you run to him, they're still looking at you.

912
00:43:11,966 --> 00:43:12,207
Yeah.

913
00:43:12,568 --> 00:43:13,570
Even though his head's down.

914
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:15,615
Even though they're down, they can look at you.

915
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:18,441
So then, you know, any striker, top class, whoosh,

916
00:43:19,042 --> 00:43:21,007
That's it, you lose the World Cup.

917
00:43:21,027 --> 00:43:25,719
So I keep my cool, I go into the angle, and then when he's about to shoot, I fall.

918
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:31,824
I work with German goalkeepers, with English goalkeepers and South American goalkeepers.

919
00:43:32,905 --> 00:43:37,992
normally the German they stay up with the hands high and they choose robotic

920
00:43:38,613 --> 00:43:40,397
The English light, they spread.

921
00:43:41,198 --> 00:43:42,601
In South America, they guess.

922
00:43:43,863 --> 00:43:45,005
That's the style.

923
00:43:45,085 --> 00:43:49,430
So if I guess and then I guess wrong, then

924
00:43:50,111 --> 00:43:50,553
Game over.

925
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:51,256
Game over.

926
00:43:51,417 --> 00:43:52,863
So if I stay like German...

927
00:43:53,948 --> 00:43:57,221
maybe, you know, you can't really go sideways.

928
00:43:57,282 --> 00:43:58,527
So if I spread,

929
00:43:59,149 --> 00:44:02,275
Maybe I don't cover how much I want to cover.

930
00:44:02,656 --> 00:44:04,641
Okay, this is all going through your head, yeah?

931
00:44:04,841 --> 00:44:06,726
This is in these split seconds.

932
00:44:06,786 --> 00:44:08,490
By the time he's going to shoot, he'll say, what am I doing?

933
00:44:08,951 --> 00:44:10,535
You need to make a decision.

934
00:44:10,595 --> 00:44:13,020
Or you go, you stay, or you jump, or you go low.

935
00:44:13,802 --> 00:44:18,278
So I thought, look, the way I was cutting the angle diagonally, I thought,

936
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:23,108
if he goes across, he can miss on the bullet.

937
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:24,690
If he goes across,

938
00:44:25,874 --> 00:44:30,268
The ball is going away from the goal and I'm going diagonally that way

939
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:34,348
to the towards the left so for that left side is quite open

940
00:44:34,871 --> 00:44:35,955
because I'm going forwards.

941
00:44:36,015 --> 00:44:36,818
I know where the goal is.

942
00:44:37,059 --> 00:44:40,191
I know exactly where the goal is because I can see the penalty spot there.

943
00:44:41,075 --> 00:44:43,064
So I thought, he's going to go there.

944
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:46,638
This is the thing we work a lot.

945
00:44:48,424 --> 00:44:50,348
body shape regarding to the ball.

946
00:44:50,749 --> 00:44:51,531
The ball is bouncing.

947
00:44:52,213 --> 00:44:53,458
So I don't keep my hands low.

948
00:44:54,301 --> 00:44:55,746
Normally it's a 1v1 low.

949
00:44:56,569 --> 00:44:57,753
You keep your hands quite low.

950
00:44:58,918 --> 00:45:03,192
The ball is bouncing, so if I keep my hands low, I leave all this open.

951
00:45:03,935 --> 00:45:06,630
So I thought, I'm guessing...

952
00:45:07,313 --> 00:45:09,936
without actually diving, that's going to go left.

953
00:45:10,196 --> 00:45:13,340
So my left leg and my left hand is really strong.

954
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,408
you know you put rock solid in your hands.

955
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:18,482
So I thought, please hit me, my face straight to the ball.

956
00:45:19,285 --> 00:45:22,117
And then I'm praying that the ball is going to go left.

957
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:23,443
Then you can save it or not.

958
00:45:24,246 --> 00:45:27,796
But then I did not move, you know, keep myself square.

959
00:45:28,097 --> 00:45:30,244
It's just brain that's going to go to that side, you know.

960
00:45:30,625 --> 00:45:33,522
and this one and you just leave it just in case you know strong as well

961
00:45:34,586 --> 00:45:37,010
And it was so quick that we nearly won it.

962
00:45:37,371 --> 00:45:39,895
And then obviously after the game, the save was huge.

963
00:45:40,497 --> 00:45:41,843
At the time, it was just so quick.

964
00:45:43,652 --> 00:45:44,215
Massive like.

965
00:45:46,678 --> 00:45:52,709
Everything you just said there is hours and hours and hours of work that he's done over the years.

966
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:57,797
holding his shape for long periods of time and having the balls to go, nah,

967
00:45:58,479 --> 00:46:01,050
I'm not triggering, I'm not falling back.

968
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:07,012
My hand position in relation to ball distance and body position in relation to ball distance is spot on.

969
00:46:07,795 --> 00:46:08,640
And you ain't beating me.

970
00:46:08,861 --> 00:46:11,357
Like you can see, it's just like, I'm not conceding.

971
00:46:11,718 --> 00:46:15,833
Like if you stay up and hold, don't trigger, don't fall back.

972
00:46:15,853 --> 00:46:16,776
So biomechanically,

973
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:18,583
Perfect.

974
00:46:18,744 --> 00:46:19,968
His shoulders haven't rotated.

975
00:46:20,008 --> 00:46:21,554
His hands haven't triggered.

976
00:46:21,975 --> 00:46:23,398
The body weight's not falling back.

977
00:46:23,478 --> 00:46:23,739
Face.

978
00:46:24,881 --> 00:46:27,206
Can you explain what triggering is for the viewers, please?

979
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:31,243
So a lot of goalies, well, goalies can trick.

980
00:46:31,263 --> 00:46:33,685
So as soon as the ball's hit, what does your body want to do?

981
00:46:34,468 --> 00:46:37,082
Naturally, your body will want to go, woof, it's coming quick now.

982
00:46:37,805 --> 00:46:41,191
So a lot of goalies will trigger the hands backwards to come forward.

983
00:46:41,211 --> 00:46:44,396
But as soon as your hands go backwards, how does that affect your body weight?

984
00:46:44,776 --> 00:46:45,919
What's your body weight going to want to do?

985
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:50,049
It's going to want to send you backwards, which means then you can't get onto your leading leg.

986
00:46:50,089 --> 00:46:51,292
You end up sweeping.

987
00:46:51,954 --> 00:46:58,569
Like things will go through you if you stay forwards and you keep your hands in good positions and you keep your chin forward and shoulders forward and

988
00:46:58,789 --> 00:47:04,583
you can react to the ball in split seconds like you can and you will naturally because your hands will always move quicker than the ball

989
00:47:05,544 --> 00:47:07,128
So your hands will move quicker than the ball ever does.

990
00:47:08,471 --> 00:47:09,633
So if you start to trigger,

991
00:47:10,215 --> 00:47:13,770
then your hands can't get to the ball because they're smoothing your body weight.

992
00:47:14,774 --> 00:47:17,466
So then you can't get, as soon as you come into neutral or negative,

993
00:47:18,008 --> 00:47:21,649
then you can't get onto your leading leg you can't literally cannot transfer

994
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:24,540
So that's hours and hours of work, like hold, hold.

995
00:47:24,982 --> 00:47:26,929
And like the stuff we did with the rebound net,

996
00:47:27,631 --> 00:47:28,652
has helped him with that.

997
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:31,356
It's like, I'm going to have to hold, I'm going to have to hold, I'm going to have to hold.

998
00:47:31,396 --> 00:47:32,598
And some of the saves that he makes

999
00:47:32,998 --> 00:47:37,484
holding his shakes for a long period of time, and how quickly he can get onto his leading legs through

1000
00:47:37,925 --> 00:47:39,191
Holding shape, transfer, push.

1001
00:47:39,252 --> 00:47:40,378
Holding shape, transfer, push.

1002
00:47:40,901 --> 00:47:41,504
Not triggering.

1003
00:47:41,664 --> 00:47:45,237
it doesn't matter how fast that ball's coming or how hard it's hit or how close it is

1004
00:47:45,699 --> 00:47:49,335
you don't if your body weight remains forward and you're not triggering from the pace of the ball

1005
00:47:49,837 --> 00:47:50,699
you're going to transfer.

1006
00:47:50,919 --> 00:47:53,405
A simple way of saying it is flinching, basically.

1007
00:47:53,425 --> 00:47:55,430
Yeah, but in a big way.

1008
00:47:55,671 --> 00:47:56,613
If you watch that set back,

1009
00:47:56,613 --> 00:48:00,486
Back in the World Cup, no flinching, just like holding, holding, holding.

1010
00:48:01,088 --> 00:48:03,094
To keep your face forward, right?

1011
00:48:03,134 --> 00:48:06,545
When somebody is about to kick a ball from five yards away.

1012
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:11,903
Natural human reaction is to try and close your eyes and you move your head to the side.

1013
00:48:12,324 --> 00:48:12,765
Watch it.

1014
00:48:13,005 --> 00:48:14,266
It is face forward.

1015
00:48:14,426 --> 00:48:16,929
And it is, if this comes right in my face, I'm going to watch it.

1016
00:48:17,991 --> 00:48:19,218
So I'm like, you know.

1017
00:48:19,238 --> 00:48:21,793
We used to work a lot on, we've got no, I can't beat you.

1018
00:48:22,115 --> 00:48:23,018
I've got nowhere to go.

1019
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,768
If you hold and you don't trigger, I cannot score.

1020
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:27,575
You're the best in the world and I can't beat you.

1021
00:48:27,856 --> 00:48:29,162
I cannot beat you, I cannot beat you.

1022
00:48:29,765 --> 00:48:30,809
I used to say it all the time.

1023
00:48:31,431 --> 00:48:36,323
Even now that I'm working with deflection nets, there's a new way that I've found.

1024
00:48:37,246 --> 00:48:38,128
You know the medicine balls?

1025
00:48:38,589 --> 00:48:39,029
In the gym.

1026
00:48:40,512 --> 00:48:44,018
I put, you know those poles, when you put poles to run?

1027
00:48:44,279 --> 00:48:44,459
Yeah.

1028
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:48,948
I put three poles and the medicine bowl on the top in between.

1029
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:52,961
So it's kind of like when you're standing, you can't see the ball.

1030
00:48:53,081 --> 00:48:54,065
So you need to go down.

1031
00:48:54,326 --> 00:48:54,486
Yeah.

1032
00:48:54,767 --> 00:48:58,876
and look it, or you go high and you, mate, try it, it's perfect.

1033
00:48:59,678 --> 00:49:03,753
Go in goal, Ben, put three poles, you know, the running poles, the one you've got zigzag.

1034
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:08,272
and put the medicine ball in the middle and go in goal.

1035
00:49:08,553 --> 00:49:09,236
Put two or three.

1036
00:49:09,878 --> 00:49:10,801
Just to try and see the ball.

1037
00:49:10,821 --> 00:49:11,804
Just to try and see the ball.

1038
00:49:11,845 --> 00:49:12,567
He's great.

1039
00:49:14,292 --> 00:49:15,936
And you know who helped me, John, the physio.

1040
00:49:16,538 --> 00:49:20,628
I remember I had a hamstring injury, so I trained a few days with him, I thought,

1041
00:49:21,149 --> 00:49:22,595
man, this is great for goalkeeping.

1042
00:49:22,696 --> 00:49:24,141
So I put in the...

1043
00:49:24,944 --> 00:49:29,609
But sometimes I put it 10 yards and then I start, you know, I like to catch balls every time.

1044
00:49:29,669 --> 00:49:30,871
Catch, catch, catch, catch up.

1045
00:49:31,672 --> 00:49:32,553
So I was catching balls.

1046
00:49:32,613 --> 00:49:34,777
I said, no, no, bring it six meters now.

1047
00:49:35,318 --> 00:49:37,041
And then I'm pushing it.

1048
00:49:37,742 --> 00:49:38,886
Now four meters.

1049
00:49:38,946 --> 00:49:40,149
Goals, goals, goals.

1050
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:44,498
And I'm working on four meters because I'm catching on eight.

1051
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,453
I'm pushing away in six, four goals.

1052
00:49:49,324 --> 00:49:51,554
by two weeks, I'm saving the one for me.

1053
00:49:51,594 --> 00:49:52,398
You're unlocking the next.

1054
00:49:52,518 --> 00:49:59,354
level then you go to three and then two it's like video games exactly I use it that way so I find a new way now it's like a new toy for me oh shit

1055
00:50:00,075 --> 00:50:05,648
if anybody had any doubts whether goalkeepers are a different breed honestly this is this is it in a nutshell isn't it this is

1056
00:50:06,029 --> 00:50:10,929
I honestly think that if outfielders had the same kind of interest in their craft

1057
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:18,206
the same dedication to the craft of stopping the ball going in the back of the net, you'd have 11 Lionel Messi's on the pitch every night.

1058
00:50:18,206 --> 00:50:19,269
every Saturday afternoon, wouldn't you?

1059
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:20,050
It's as simple as that.

1060
00:50:20,171 --> 00:50:20,571
That's important.

1061
00:50:20,592 --> 00:50:23,999
I think you spoke about John Whitney, who's a sports scientist, strength and conditioning coach.

1062
00:50:25,282 --> 00:50:31,104
mainly outfield, but with such an in-depth knowledge of the biomechanics or biomechanical movement

1063
00:50:31,745 --> 00:50:37,173
That he can help you a lot couldn't he probably helped you a lot with India within your physio and your rehab like and

1064
00:50:37,374 --> 00:50:40,523
If you've got that in-depth knowledge of biomechanics and how goalkeepers move, huge.

1065
00:50:41,164 --> 00:50:41,685
Right then, mate.

1066
00:50:41,725 --> 00:50:42,766
So you've made the save.

1067
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:43,607
Full-time whistle's gone.

1068
00:50:43,627 --> 00:50:44,748
Penalty shootout, okay?

1069
00:50:45,048 --> 00:50:47,651
This is... We were watching it, wasn't we?

1070
00:50:48,113 --> 00:50:50,809
And we knew what was gonna happen.

1071
00:50:50,889 --> 00:50:51,533
It was inevitable.

1072
00:50:51,834 --> 00:50:55,123
and this is no slight on Hugo Lloris, but

1073
00:50:55,664 --> 00:51:00,110
when you put Hugo Lloris in goal and then you put you in goal, the size difference is just phenomenal.

1074
00:51:01,152 --> 00:51:03,499
so sort of daunting and you just failed the goal.

1075
00:51:03,699 --> 00:51:04,702
I don't think it's size though, is it?

1076
00:51:05,725 --> 00:51:06,347
What do you think it is?

1077
00:51:06,809 --> 00:51:08,273
I think it's personality.

1078
00:51:08,615 --> 00:51:09,056
Aura.

1079
00:51:09,257 --> 00:51:09,497
Aura.

1080
00:51:09,798 --> 00:51:10,802
I think it's, again, it's,

1081
00:51:11,243 --> 00:51:13,354
It boils down to confidence to the point of arrogance.

1082
00:51:13,394 --> 00:51:15,465
You see the look on the face and the way you hold yourself.

1083
00:51:16,147 --> 00:51:17,509
Small goalies can strip well, yeah?

1084
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:21,633
Like you've got some small goalies that you think are big on the pitch when they're quite small.

1085
00:51:22,274 --> 00:51:24,219
And some goalies that are big and look small.

1086
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:28,211
The big ones that look small in the goal and come off the pitch and go, yeah, actually quite big.

1087
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:28,993
Yeah, it's true, yeah.

1088
00:51:29,153 --> 00:51:33,192
And it's like, it's what you bring in terms of your personality.

1089
00:51:33,212 --> 00:51:33,292
Yeah.

1090
00:51:33,693 --> 00:51:39,498
it's like the um we went to man united away and the ronaldo thing remember it yeah yeah

1091
00:51:39,999 --> 00:51:41,926
And who was it who missed the penalty?

1092
00:51:42,047 --> 00:51:42,348
Bruno.

1093
00:51:42,368 --> 00:51:42,870
Bruno.

1094
00:51:43,171 --> 00:51:44,356
And we spoke about it before, didn't we?

1095
00:51:44,376 --> 00:51:45,099
What, what, what?

1096
00:51:45,219 --> 00:51:50,311
What little details can you bring into your game that's going to make you this person?

1097
00:51:50,612 --> 00:51:51,755
And it has to be that.

1098
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:53,721
personality.

1099
00:51:54,183 --> 00:51:57,856
You've got to bring an aura, a personality, a real like.

1100
00:51:58,558 --> 00:51:59,401
I'm not going to get beat.

1101
00:51:59,461 --> 00:52:01,950
Whereas it's not down to size.

1102
00:52:02,331 --> 00:52:03,014
It's your presence.

1103
00:52:03,234 --> 00:52:05,019
We said that when we were watching the game.

1104
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,102
We actually said that

1105
00:52:06,805 --> 00:52:08,192
And he's making the goal look small.

1106
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:08,554
Yeah.

1107
00:52:08,755 --> 00:52:08,936
Yeah.

1108
00:52:08,956 --> 00:52:10,504
And like you were saying earlier on, cuts about...

1109
00:52:10,805 --> 00:52:13,232
how you conduct yourself, you know, shoulders back.

1110
00:52:13,312 --> 00:52:14,355
It's that aura, isn't it?

1111
00:52:14,415 --> 00:52:15,337
Making yourself big.

1112
00:52:15,598 --> 00:52:16,019
Bigger.

1113
00:52:16,139 --> 00:52:18,702
You know, he'd look in his eyes and go, he's saving it.

1114
00:52:19,062 --> 00:52:19,282
Yeah.

1115
00:52:19,343 --> 00:52:20,083
It's not because he's big.

1116
00:52:20,404 --> 00:52:20,544
Yeah.

1117
00:52:20,564 --> 00:52:21,025
It's just like...

1118
00:52:21,665 --> 00:52:22,206
Yeah.

1119
00:52:22,486 --> 00:52:24,789
Even I suppose it's a lanky after getting to you.

1120
00:52:24,929 --> 00:52:25,831
Why do you put it so high?

1121
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,112
I've never seen you put in that high.

1122
00:52:27,152 --> 00:52:27,513
So may

1123
00:52:27,993 --> 00:52:31,419
i don't know where to go you you made it i have to go really yeah

1124
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:34,927
I actually asked Solanki, I said, it's a great pen, but why do you go so high?

1125
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:38,702
We watch penalties, so you never go that high.

1126
00:52:39,425 --> 00:52:41,308
I said, mate, I have to change something.

1127
00:52:41,389 --> 00:52:42,190
I have to go there.

1128
00:52:42,631 --> 00:52:44,194
Because he knows you'll save it otherwise.

1129
00:52:44,394 --> 00:52:45,156
Yeah, that's fascinating.

1130
00:52:45,677 --> 00:52:47,461
You know, you can get there to the side.

1131
00:52:47,681 --> 00:52:50,287
I know you can get to the side, so I have to put a right in the corner.

1132
00:52:50,387 --> 00:52:54,933
This is what this, that, that I will only back myself up a little bit and say, when I say about size, right?

1133
00:52:55,054 --> 00:52:55,835
Some of the penalties,

1134
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:57,740
you are nearly touching the post.

1135
00:52:58,282 --> 00:53:00,770
By the time you finish a sable, when you get your hand on the ball,

1136
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:02,134
you're nearly on the post.

1137
00:53:02,294 --> 00:53:03,097
That's not size, is it?

1138
00:53:03,377 --> 00:53:04,280
It's got to be size.

1139
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:04,621
No.

1140
00:53:04,822 --> 00:53:05,283
What is it?

1141
00:53:05,444 --> 00:53:05,544
It's...

1142
00:53:06,025 --> 00:53:12,253
speed power push and power you don't have to yeah i think i believe that is power and timing yeah

1143
00:53:12,834 --> 00:53:13,255
Timing.

1144
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,623
I'm all over this.

1145
00:53:16,723 --> 00:53:19,570
I'm not saying, I always say if you get the timing right,

1146
00:53:20,713 --> 00:53:23,840
I'll reach a post just the timing if you're going to save a penalty you don't

1147
00:53:24,221 --> 00:53:25,285
go to the ball, dear.

1148
00:53:25,305 --> 00:53:26,468
To be fair, anyone can save a penalty.

1149
00:53:26,489 --> 00:53:29,960
Go through the ball, go past the ball, his speed and his power, how quick he can go from here to there.

1150
00:53:30,622 --> 00:53:30,802
Right?

1151
00:53:31,023 --> 00:53:32,065
And it has to be like, boom.

1152
00:53:32,406 --> 00:53:33,649
So it's timing and speed and power.

1153
00:53:34,371 --> 00:53:36,997
Speed equals distance divided by... How quickly you can transfer your body weight, isn't it?

1154
00:53:37,619 --> 00:53:39,728
how quickly you can get onto your leading leg.

1155
00:53:39,748 --> 00:53:40,672
I've got to ask you, Emi,

1156
00:53:41,273 --> 00:53:46,180
Some of the viewers might think this is a strange question, but we've had professor Steve Peters on psychologists on

1157
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:48,165
And they talk about the gold medal syndrome.

1158
00:53:48,205 --> 00:53:50,852
Now, World Cup's the biggest prize you can win.

1159
00:53:50,953 --> 00:53:52,517
Did you have a moment where you had that...

1160
00:53:53,058 --> 00:53:56,965
gold medal syndrome where you almost had a low after or not.

1161
00:53:57,687 --> 00:53:57,948
No.

1162
00:53:58,269 --> 00:53:59,112
Not just high.

1163
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:00,016
Always high, yeah.

1164
00:54:00,638 --> 00:54:00,859
But...

1165
00:54:02,244 --> 00:54:06,169
After the shoot, after the World Cup, when I was home, I said,

1166
00:54:06,931 --> 00:54:11,740
i reached my dream i can't go any higher because the feeling i had after that work up is like

1167
00:54:12,361 --> 00:54:15,946
Even if I win the next one, I already know what I felt.

1168
00:54:16,767 --> 00:54:18,109
So now what's next?

1169
00:54:18,509 --> 00:54:20,832
When you win the Golden Glove in the Copa America,

1170
00:54:21,352 --> 00:54:23,915
You win the Super Cup, you win the Golden Glove and the World Cup.

1171
00:54:24,476 --> 00:54:25,697
It's like, what else can I win?

1172
00:54:26,419 --> 00:54:30,747
Like, if you win the best on Yashin, which I won, it's just individual, you know.

1173
00:54:31,588 --> 00:54:34,615
I wanted the World Cup since I was five years old.

1174
00:54:35,056 --> 00:54:36,800
My boy is obsessed with the World Cup.

1175
00:54:37,141 --> 00:54:37,923
That's why I wanted to win.

1176
00:54:38,925 --> 00:54:42,093
But now that's when the psychology comes.

1177
00:54:43,416 --> 00:54:43,978
What's next?

1178
00:54:44,199 --> 00:54:47,549
How can I be motivated when I already reached my dreams?

1179
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:49,555
It kind of answers my question.

1180
00:54:49,595 --> 00:54:52,563
Like I said, maybe I positioned it incorrectly and low, but...

1181
00:54:52,944 --> 00:54:54,267
I always find a way.

1182
00:54:54,728 --> 00:54:58,214
I want to get Aston Villa in the Champions League.

1183
00:54:58,917 --> 00:54:59,881
I was upset with it.

1184
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:02,273
I was like, I need to get this club because he...

1185
00:55:02,734 --> 00:55:08,448
I won the World Cup after 38 years in Argentina, won the Copa America after 30 years,

1186
00:55:09,149 --> 00:55:11,132
We never beat Brazil in the Maracanã.

1187
00:55:12,153 --> 00:55:15,517
The first game that they lost in qualifiers in history was against us.

1188
00:55:15,657 --> 00:55:18,971
in December, so I always find leader target like

1189
00:55:19,353 --> 00:55:25,031
huge target because let's say you play for Man United you qualify you make top four it's

1190
00:55:25,933 --> 00:55:27,718
You know, it's a big season.

1191
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:32,269
Even if he's starting on with Chelsea, it's more or less anyone can do it or, you know, it's a big club.

1192
00:55:32,972 --> 00:55:35,046
Aston Villa 42 years I said what if

1193
00:55:36,172 --> 00:55:36,634
I can do it.

1194
00:55:37,015 --> 00:55:38,539
What if we're done?

1195
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:39,442
It's something like...

1196
00:55:40,083 --> 00:55:43,568
it's hard to do special it's it's that's me it's challenging myself

1197
00:55:44,069 --> 00:55:46,756
That's the equivalent of Man City winning the league, isn't it?

1198
00:55:46,837 --> 00:55:48,181
Really, let's be honest.

1199
00:55:48,321 --> 00:55:49,785
Villa getting in the Champions League is...

1200
00:55:50,327 --> 00:55:50,607
It's huge.

1201
00:55:50,627 --> 00:55:52,231
It's absolutely monumental.

1202
00:55:52,371 --> 00:55:55,178
And for me, and I say that to my mum, I say that to my agents,

1203
00:55:56,922 --> 00:55:59,668
It means more staying in a club like Villa

1204
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:02,800
and deliver what I was dreaming.

1205
00:56:03,142 --> 00:56:04,848
It's like winning a title with Argentina.

1206
00:56:05,491 --> 00:56:06,033
So what next?

1207
00:56:06,054 --> 00:56:08,725
You've got to win the Champions League then because you've ticked everything else off, haven't you?

1208
00:56:08,745 --> 00:56:10,191
Well, it's a title next week.

1209
00:56:10,975 --> 00:56:11,537
I like that.

1210
00:56:11,638 --> 00:56:13,325
Yeah, that's that's next.

1211
00:56:13,365 --> 00:56:13,626
All right.

1212
00:56:13,646 --> 00:56:14,309
Can I take you back to the

1213
00:56:14,349 --> 00:56:15,192
penalties then, okay?

1214
00:56:15,212 --> 00:56:18,241
So this is where the programme notes start to come into their own, Emi, all right?

1215
00:56:18,682 --> 00:56:22,309
Was you aware, by the way, before the penalty shootout started that you were going to kind of

1216
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:24,717
Just do a little bit of theatrics.

1217
00:56:24,758 --> 00:56:27,188
Just try and get in the head of the French players a little bit.

1218
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:34,220
Yeah, obviously I spoke with the psychologist about it because when you're controlling the game,

1219
00:56:35,445 --> 00:56:38,140
you concede three goals is like well at

1220
00:56:38,321 --> 00:56:39,848
I didn't really have a good game there.

1221
00:56:39,928 --> 00:56:41,877
Three goals conceded in five shots.

1222
00:56:43,204 --> 00:56:45,895
made a good save at the end, but that was it really.

1223
00:56:46,658 --> 00:56:51,122
When I go into a shootout, it's like I bring my boy into the playground.

1224
00:56:52,003 --> 00:56:54,087
You know, he's crying in the car.

1225
00:56:54,128 --> 00:56:54,969
Oh, Santi playground.

1226
00:56:55,911 --> 00:56:58,543
And actually, I feel like I dominate that area.

1227
00:56:59,507 --> 00:57:02,661
I can lose, win, or I can save one or not.

1228
00:57:03,645 --> 00:57:07,182
If you watch me, I went straight into the goal.

1229
00:57:08,044 --> 00:57:13,214
Even I had a shootout as well the other day and I went into the goal like, this is my zone, I need to control it, you know.

1230
00:57:14,096 --> 00:57:16,766
And then obviously I like to watch goalie.

1231
00:57:16,786 --> 00:57:17,790
I watch a lot of football.

1232
00:57:17,870 --> 00:57:18,934
I watch football every day.

1233
00:57:19,637 --> 00:57:22,509
And then I seen Lloris so many years in the Premier League.

1234
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:23,072
I know how...

1235
00:57:23,634 --> 00:57:25,201
what he brings to the table.

1236
00:57:25,222 --> 00:57:26,427
He's a really good goalie, but

1237
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:28,840
In that time, it's like it's me against him.

1238
00:57:29,001 --> 00:57:30,228
It's not me against Mpappe.

1239
00:57:31,172 --> 00:57:33,239
You know, people say, no, you in the head.

1240
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:34,422
I'm in my head.

1241
00:57:35,124 --> 00:57:36,167
It's me against Lloris.

1242
00:57:37,271 --> 00:57:41,829
Is Messi against Mbappe or is, I don't know, Otamendi against Konati?

1243
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:43,391
It's me against Lloris.

1244
00:57:43,511 --> 00:57:45,413
And I knew that fact at that moment.

1245
00:57:45,593 --> 00:57:47,555
Maybe he got more experience than me.

1246
00:57:47,695 --> 00:57:48,676
Maybe he played more games.

1247
00:57:49,579 --> 00:57:52,091
But I fall in that moment, I'm way better than you.

1248
00:57:53,719 --> 00:57:55,705
She's in that different game, which is shootout.

1249
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:57,672
So that's when I come.

1250
00:57:57,852 --> 00:57:58,755
If I beat Lloris...

1251
00:57:59,157 --> 00:58:01,709
I got a big chance to win the World Cup.

1252
00:58:01,971 --> 00:58:02,473
It's like...

1253
00:58:03,697 --> 00:58:06,700
when it goes to penalties, it's almost like, right, it's Emi's time now.

1254
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:07,241
It's a different game.

1255
00:58:07,301 --> 00:58:08,262
It's my house now.

1256
00:58:08,502 --> 00:58:09,426
This is it.

1257
00:58:09,446 --> 00:58:10,731
And that's how it goes down, isn't it?

1258
00:58:10,771 --> 00:58:11,253
Yeah, it is.

1259
00:58:12,076 --> 00:58:13,180
All right then, the first penalty.

1260
00:58:15,087 --> 00:58:15,929
Mbappe.

1261
00:58:17,733 --> 00:58:18,956
Top hand, nearly.

1262
00:58:19,578 --> 00:58:19,979
Nearly.

1263
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:21,865
Were you disappointed with the first penalty?

1264
00:58:22,441 --> 00:58:24,630
Yeah, can we talk about timing in the goalkeeping?

1265
00:58:24,650 --> 00:58:26,838
Timing, get it at night, obviously...

1266
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:32,204
Messi spoke about it and he does two, three steps and goes straight into the ball.

1267
00:58:32,224 --> 00:58:32,664
So I was...

1268
00:58:33,706 --> 00:58:35,369
By the time he's shooting, I'm still skipping.

1269
00:58:35,971 --> 00:58:38,175
Maybe she's gone a little bit earlier.

1270
00:58:38,596 --> 00:58:41,880
And then because I concede already too, I knew he was going right.

1271
00:58:42,361 --> 00:58:44,384
I knew, I definitely knew he was going right.

1272
00:58:45,025 --> 00:58:47,551
But then I thought, why did I not go a little bit early?

1273
00:58:48,673 --> 00:58:51,560
And then I went low rather than high, mid-high.

1274
00:58:51,941 --> 00:58:54,246
And I knew that he likes mid-high.

1275
00:58:56,911 --> 00:58:59,814
Shit, you know, I got it wrong, got it all wrong.

1276
00:59:00,396 --> 00:59:03,169
got it all wrong because for me that's a comfortable safe.

1277
00:59:03,209 --> 00:59:04,394
So, but at the end,

1278
00:59:05,318 --> 00:59:07,023
I didn't think, oh, it's not my day.

1279
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:07,906
I can't say one.

1280
00:59:07,966 --> 00:59:09,631
I just went, if I say two...

1281
00:59:11,076 --> 00:59:12,944
It's coming, it's coming.

1282
00:59:13,024 --> 00:59:13,868
One's going to come in a minute.

1283
00:59:14,269 --> 00:59:17,795
When you were watching this Cuts on Holiday, you were at this point just a bag of nerves.

1284
00:59:19,538 --> 00:59:20,740
You probably should have said that.

1285
00:59:21,761 --> 00:59:22,442
He would have said that.

1286
00:59:22,482 --> 00:59:24,325
That's why I said it, because I know that's what he would have said.

1287
00:59:25,067 --> 00:59:29,084
Yeah, it's difficult because you're so far away and all you want to do is for him to win.

1288
00:59:29,104 --> 00:59:29,847
It's like...

1289
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:32,920
You can't scream at the telly and say, you should have saved that, all right?

1290
00:59:33,121 --> 00:59:33,844
What are you doing?

1291
00:59:34,205 --> 00:59:34,526
Yeah.

1292
00:59:34,787 --> 00:59:35,350
No, not quite.

1293
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:38,100
I'm just like desperate for him to win.

1294
00:59:39,747 --> 00:59:42,438
Okay, so then Messi takes the next penalty.

1295
00:59:43,523 --> 00:59:45,274
Excuse my language, it's a piss take of a penalty.

1296
00:59:45,294 --> 00:59:46,784
It is a piss take of a penalty, right?

1297
00:59:47,586 --> 00:59:52,092
I talk about then how Lloris do, you know, how he behaves.

1298
00:59:52,152 --> 00:59:53,654
I said, if you stop, you're going to score.

1299
00:59:53,854 --> 00:59:59,567
Because I remember Jorginho against him in the Premier League.

1300
00:59:59,868 --> 01:00:02,415
I think Vardy stopped as well against him.

1301
01:00:02,435 --> 01:00:03,357
He went way too early.

1302
01:00:03,397 --> 01:00:05,122
So I said, Leo, just stop and go.

1303
01:00:06,065 --> 01:00:06,626
He will move.

1304
01:00:06,867 --> 01:00:08,612
He moves to his left.

1305
01:00:08,873 --> 01:00:11,460
He rolls it not far off the centre of it.

1306
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:12,323
In a World Cup final.

1307
01:00:12,925 --> 01:00:14,109
He won't stay in the middle.

1308
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:15,836
Lloris will never stay in the middle.

1309
01:00:16,358 --> 01:00:20,376
So it's kind of like when I talk to my teammates in the national team, they listen as well.

1310
01:00:21,441 --> 01:00:24,414
i said go to the middle go in the middle go one at least one in the middle

1311
01:00:25,136 --> 01:00:28,687
So we scored two out of five because I was through the middle.

1312
01:00:30,252 --> 01:00:32,805
And then Kingsley Coman steps up.

1313
01:00:33,709 --> 01:00:35,895
Big save, comfortable save.

1314
01:00:36,356 --> 01:00:39,563
When you dive in that way, and it almost hits you in the chest, doesn't it?

1315
01:00:39,584 --> 01:00:40,566
It does hit you in the chest, yeah.

1316
01:00:40,806 --> 01:00:46,592
I missed it are you you just know you're saving it though don't you because you've already you're so you almost drive past it don't you

1317
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:52,546
yeah but you know i i watched penalties the day before and i watched griezmann

1318
01:00:53,228 --> 01:00:58,480
jerut empape baran and afimwani

1319
01:00:59,582 --> 01:01:02,429
So then Griezmann wasn't on the pitch.

1320
01:01:02,449 --> 01:01:03,752
Giroud wasn't on the pitch.

1321
01:01:03,913 --> 01:01:06,038
Dembele wasn't on the pitch, I looked.

1322
01:01:07,062 --> 01:01:08,087
Baran wasn't on the pitch.

1323
01:01:08,730 --> 01:01:11,082
So for the in-comer, I said, I don't know where he's going.

1324
01:01:11,263 --> 01:01:16,641
So that's when it comes, you know, that intuition that I always believe that I back myself up.

1325
01:01:16,822 --> 01:01:17,825
So it's about timing.

1326
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:22,231
And that's when I got a really, really, I'll say I jumped more than I should have.

1327
01:01:22,952 --> 01:01:27,242
It's more just, you know, I was probably so nervous.

1328
01:01:27,664 --> 01:01:31,316
Not so nervous, but so tense that I missed the ball and it hit my chest.

1329
01:01:33,182 --> 01:01:37,797
And that feeling, the way I was jumping, if he goes, yeah, that's me, that's me, I got it right, you know.

1330
01:01:38,239 --> 01:01:42,730
I didn't because I was so frustrated for before for not saving them puppies.

1331
01:01:43,874 --> 01:01:45,585
for that's more like me, you know?

1332
01:01:45,706 --> 01:01:45,908
Yeah.

1333
01:01:47,396 --> 01:01:48,457
That I find interesting.

1334
01:01:48,477 --> 01:01:51,420
You know where he says about that tense feeling, that nerve, it's not nerve feeling.

1335
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:52,941
It's like, it's so much energy.

1336
01:01:53,984 --> 01:01:59,240
isn't it it's so well it's hard to describe that you almost can't feel your fingers

1337
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:00,382
What, adrenaline?

1338
01:02:00,402 --> 01:02:00,863
Crazy.

1339
01:02:02,326 --> 01:02:05,271
Concentration or I don't know what that is, but it's just...

1340
01:02:06,915 --> 01:02:08,720
You know goalies having cramps.

1341
01:02:09,061 --> 01:02:10,244
How can a goalie have a cramp?

1342
01:02:10,524 --> 01:02:15,129
It's because you're so tense, you're so nervous that your muscle contracts, isn't it?

1343
01:02:15,149 --> 01:02:16,130
Yeah, that's right.

1344
01:02:18,199 --> 01:02:20,147
It was a comfortable save in the end.

1345
01:02:21,451 --> 01:02:23,816
I want to talk about the Cermény penalty though.

1346
01:02:23,916 --> 01:02:26,300
So third penalty for France, he drags it wide.

1347
01:02:27,265 --> 01:02:30,644
But this is where, and we're going to talk about shithousery in a minute if that's okay.

1348
01:02:31,567 --> 01:02:33,591
But this is where you came into your own a little bit.

1349
01:02:33,631 --> 01:02:34,453
I was buzzing off it.

1350
01:02:34,493 --> 01:02:36,377
I think it's a fair play if you can do it.

1351
01:02:36,999 --> 01:02:39,986
do it all day long you throw the ball away a little bit

1352
01:02:40,468 --> 01:02:44,221
And the bit that I really like about this and we talked about it a minute ago is

1353
01:02:44,763 --> 01:02:47,791
Um, the camera sort of pans to Tiumeni's face and he,

1354
01:02:48,072 --> 01:02:49,337
And he's trying to act all cool.

1355
01:02:49,457 --> 01:02:50,802
Like, I'm not fazed by this.

1356
01:02:50,822 --> 01:02:51,966
This ain't even a thing, all right?

1357
01:02:52,427 --> 01:02:53,170
And he has this little...

1358
01:02:53,833 --> 01:02:57,268
double nervous grin honestly it's so double nervous it's ridiculous right

1359
01:02:57,549 --> 01:02:59,932
And I'm thinking, oh, mate, I don't like the look of that.

1360
01:03:00,232 --> 01:03:02,915
Then the camera pans to Didier Deschamps on the sidelines.

1361
01:03:03,155 --> 01:03:07,343
and he's fuming it yeah he's like effing and jeffing and cussing and all that kind of stuff

1362
01:03:07,845 --> 01:03:09,532
And it comes back to Tumeni.

1363
01:03:09,793 --> 01:03:12,123
He steps up to take the penalty and it's inevitable.

1364
01:03:12,344 --> 01:03:12,625
Isn't it?

1365
01:03:12,745 --> 01:03:14,308
It is inevitable what he's going to do.

1366
01:03:14,348 --> 01:03:15,832
You know, I'll come to you because.

1367
01:03:16,112 --> 01:03:17,296
You know he's going to drag it, don't you?

1368
01:03:17,476 --> 01:03:18,880
Yeah, and it is one of them.

1369
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:19,482
You can see it.

1370
01:03:19,602 --> 01:03:20,465
You can see it on his face.

1371
01:03:20,485 --> 01:03:22,290
You're like, oh, he's not quite sure, this boy.

1372
01:03:23,032 --> 01:03:25,963
And then that's when you know you've got one over straight away.

1373
01:03:26,043 --> 01:03:27,287
It's like, I've got him.

1374
01:03:27,548 --> 01:03:28,150
Like, I've got him.

1375
01:03:29,475 --> 01:03:34,050
But I knew it was the time because I'm never doing the first pen or the second one.

1376
01:03:34,751 --> 01:03:37,474
It's when I got a big chance that we can win it.

1377
01:03:37,574 --> 01:03:40,716
So I saved, I nearly got in pappers against the side.

1378
01:03:41,437 --> 01:03:42,319
I got a second one.

1379
01:03:42,739 --> 01:03:44,482
So I'm thinking when I

1380
01:03:45,807 --> 01:03:48,741
When I look at the young lad coming, it's like, if he missed that pen...

1381
01:03:50,906 --> 01:03:53,312
they might be losing this World Cup.

1382
01:03:53,432 --> 01:03:55,336
So I thought, that's when, what am I doing?

1383
01:03:56,138 --> 01:03:58,264
I said, he needs to go and get it further up.

1384
01:03:58,404 --> 01:03:59,708
You know, he needs it further up.

1385
01:03:59,748 --> 01:04:01,012
I need to do something, you know.

1386
01:04:01,152 --> 01:04:02,215
That's personality, isn't it?

1387
01:04:02,435 --> 01:04:04,479
And the ref was like... Pure personality and presence.

1388
01:04:04,539 --> 01:04:06,763
The ref didn't know what to do, you know, I felt like, no.

1389
01:04:06,963 --> 01:04:08,806
I just keep walking, you know, I just keep walking.

1390
01:04:08,826 --> 01:04:10,088
You threw it just the right.

1391
01:04:10,309 --> 01:04:10,889
Yeah, perfect.

1392
01:04:12,532 --> 01:04:14,820
Because it's hard, you know, when you walk.

1393
01:04:16,124 --> 01:04:21,492
yards to take the penalty, how many yards is, I don't know, but in a World Cup final.

1394
01:04:22,434 --> 01:04:26,449
You can practice 150 penalties in training and you can put in the top corner.

1395
01:04:26,490 --> 01:04:27,413
Top bins are easy.

1396
01:04:27,854 --> 01:04:31,082
And then when you go into a World Cup final behind all Argentinian fans,

1397
01:04:31,564 --> 01:04:35,294
They were singing, which that means he will eat you up.

1398
01:04:37,222 --> 01:04:39,734
I'm saying he's going to be feeling something at all.

1399
01:04:40,016 --> 01:04:41,243
I know he played for Real Madrid.

1400
01:04:41,344 --> 01:04:42,591
He'd be feeling something.

1401
01:04:42,852 --> 01:04:43,717
I can see it in his face.

1402
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:48,990
But then you need to have that luck that you save it or not because otherwise you look like a twat.

1403
01:04:49,030 --> 01:04:49,411
Yeah.

1404
01:04:51,256 --> 01:04:56,788
So, and then he, I knew it was going to cross his body shape.

1405
01:04:57,008 --> 01:04:57,429
Kicking glue.

1406
01:04:58,998 --> 01:05:00,688
You know, you've been a goalie, you can see more or less.

1407
01:05:01,754 --> 01:05:06,473
you can't really guess by his body shape he can't go he cannot be his foot he was like he's so close

1408
01:05:06,693 --> 01:05:13,370
off it's the only place he can go and I thought if he was going in I would definitely save it I feel like something

1409
01:05:14,078 --> 01:05:14,503
You know when you...

1410
01:05:17,398 --> 01:05:21,506
You know, when you don't touch it, but you feel like the air or something in your hands.

1411
01:05:21,846 --> 01:05:22,267
I touch it.

1412
01:05:22,889 --> 01:05:25,960
Yeah, that's why I started dancing because I thought, yeah, I got him.

1413
01:05:26,823 --> 01:05:28,149
So that's what I want to talk about.

1414
01:05:28,189 --> 01:05:29,877
I've got here the horrible shoulder dance.

1415
01:05:30,599 --> 01:05:33,701
I swear my mum's like, I've never, ever done it.

1416
01:05:33,721 --> 01:05:35,263
I can't even move my shoulders nowadays.

1417
01:05:35,343 --> 01:05:36,924
I don't know how I've done it.

1418
01:05:37,645 --> 01:05:39,651
I've never practiced it.

1419
01:05:40,453 --> 01:05:41,335
It's so good.

1420
01:05:41,676 --> 01:05:43,020
That just came up in that moment.

1421
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:44,524
Do you know how many kids are doing that now?

1422
01:05:44,644 --> 01:05:45,426
Oh, I know.

1423
01:05:46,709 --> 01:05:49,235
A friend of ours, we're going to do a podcast with him, and he said,

1424
01:05:50,639 --> 01:05:51,784
our little lad at the weekend.

1425
01:05:51,804 --> 01:05:52,507
Doing the whole thing.

1426
01:05:53,772 --> 01:05:55,015
Horrible, it was so horrible.

1427
01:05:55,036 --> 01:05:59,105
We went to Dubai with my wife and my kids and said, and these young lads, you know, on the beach,

1428
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:03,379
Look what you've done.

1429
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:04,584
I said, what can I do?

1430
01:06:04,624 --> 01:06:05,126
You know what I mean?

1431
01:06:05,146 --> 01:06:05,307
Yeah.

1432
01:06:05,808 --> 01:06:12,283
Another thing I really liked as well then is when Paredes scored his penalty and you kind of sprinted to him, he sprinted to you.

1433
01:06:12,744 --> 01:06:15,757
And that unity of you two, it's like...

1434
01:06:16,018 --> 01:06:17,503
that was your 18-yard box.

1435
01:06:17,544 --> 01:06:18,065
You know what I mean?

1436
01:06:18,206 --> 01:06:21,297
It was like it was... That whole area was just Argentine.

1437
01:06:21,799 --> 01:06:21,919
And...

1438
01:06:22,502 --> 01:06:26,622
I think the French would have even seen that happening, that little celebration and gone,

1439
01:06:27,185 --> 01:06:27,849
we don't belong here.

1440
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:29,096
Like they sent ours.

1441
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:30,684
It was inevitable at that point, wasn't it?

1442
01:06:30,965 --> 01:06:34,831
it becomes a habit you know because they're so good at penalties you know because

1443
01:06:35,372 --> 01:06:39,000
Hugo Paredes, oh my God, he can strike Messi, Dybala.

1444
01:06:39,522 --> 01:06:43,350
You got Montiel, never miss a pin, outpaning his career.

1445
01:06:43,811 --> 01:06:44,412
McAllister.

1446
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:50,472
six he was a six taker he got so many takers i thought mate with the takers i got

1447
01:06:51,074 --> 01:06:51,597
Di Maria.

1448
01:06:51,617 --> 01:06:51,938
Yeah.

1449
01:07:11,507 --> 01:07:13,370
If I say one or two, that's it.

1450
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:14,832
And they know that I can save it.

1451
01:07:15,073 --> 01:07:15,994
I've done it every time.

1452
01:07:16,034 --> 01:07:17,136
So I thought, you know, it's a...

1453
01:07:17,818 --> 01:07:22,097
That unity, like you said, once we got to penalties, we win.

1454
01:07:22,358 --> 01:07:23,482
You can win or lose.

1455
01:07:24,366 --> 01:07:25,791
It doesn't mean we're going to win every time.

1456
01:07:26,673 --> 01:07:28,757
I always say the big ones we already done it.

1457
01:07:29,077 --> 01:07:31,421
And when Gonzalo Montiel puts that penalty in,

1458
01:07:33,665 --> 01:07:36,406
The celebration is incredible, but what's it like for him now?

1459
01:07:36,447 --> 01:07:39,589
Because I can only kind of imagine in England, right, if...

1460
01:07:40,210 --> 01:07:40,952
I don't know who it is.

1461
01:07:41,192 --> 01:07:45,362
Somebody, John Stones runs up and scores that winning penalty for England, right?

1462
01:07:45,422 --> 01:07:46,766
He's just done that for Argentina.

1463
01:07:47,107 --> 01:07:48,273
What is he like at home?

1464
01:07:48,413 --> 01:07:49,539
Is he a hero?

1465
01:07:49,579 --> 01:07:49,619
Is...

1466
01:07:50,985 --> 01:07:54,751
Is the whole team a hero or is there something reserved specially for him?

1467
01:07:55,593 --> 01:07:59,910
You know when you're a young lad, you've got memories, isn't it?

1468
01:08:00,271 --> 01:08:04,122
So every child in Argentina, we remember Montiel.

1469
01:08:05,285 --> 01:08:11,481
like Agüero, you know, and that moment, you know, when you're young, you just, you've got memories, so...

1470
01:08:12,303 --> 01:08:18,117
I think whatever happens in Montiel's career, he will be well known back home forever, you know.

1471
01:08:18,297 --> 01:08:19,722
Forever, forever a legend.

1472
01:08:19,983 --> 01:08:21,708
I loved it when it finished because it was

1473
01:08:22,210 --> 01:08:25,299
No one will remember Paredes penalty in 10 years.

1474
01:08:25,399 --> 01:08:25,820
No chance.

1475
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:26,141
Montiel's.

1476
01:08:27,344 --> 01:08:33,772
Maybe Messi, Maizé and Montillo, even though he played 10 minutes in the World Cup, in the final.

1477
01:08:34,252 --> 01:08:40,331
really yeah there was two there was two focal points of the celebration wasn't there there was you and there was there was messy

1478
01:08:41,094 --> 01:08:44,967
And then half the team kind of split and it was just, it was absolute chaos, wasn't it?

1479
01:08:45,047 --> 01:08:45,910
There's no fans more

1480
01:08:45,970 --> 01:08:47,011
passionate than Argentina.

1481
01:08:47,051 --> 01:08:47,612
No, no.

1482
01:08:47,913 --> 01:08:49,134
They're like incredible, aren't they?

1483
01:08:49,154 --> 01:08:51,798
I always say to you, come to Argentina to watch me play.

1484
01:08:51,818 --> 01:08:52,298
It's just...

1485
01:08:52,839 --> 01:08:55,129
I went to Miami tonight just before you went to the World Cup.

1486
01:08:55,611 --> 01:08:55,732
Yeah.

1487
01:08:56,274 --> 01:08:57,896
before probably the last camp that you went to.

1488
01:08:57,936 --> 01:09:00,801
In Argentina they choose 60,000 pounds singing and

1489
01:09:00,981 --> 01:09:04,382
jumping and then you just go back placing your tummy and then

1490
01:09:04,885 --> 01:09:09,062
The adrenaline, you know, I never felt pressure before, ever.

1491
01:09:10,106 --> 01:09:13,800
Obviously, when you're young, yes, but when I was older, I never thought coming into a game

1492
01:09:14,542 --> 01:09:17,985
But when I went into the first game of the World Cup.

1493
01:09:18,025 --> 01:09:18,726
Saudi Arabia game.

1494
01:09:18,766 --> 01:09:19,527
Saudi Arabia game.

1495
01:09:19,988 --> 01:09:23,381
And I walk onto the pitch with all the fans screaming in that scenario.

1496
01:09:24,104 --> 01:09:27,189
I felt like a heat inside my body that I'd never felt before, ever.

1497
01:09:27,970 --> 01:09:32,715
And I felt it in the World Cup final going into the warm up.

1498
01:09:32,795 --> 01:09:33,736
Then in the game, I was good.

1499
01:09:34,537 --> 01:09:40,125
But running into my zone, the area, the box with the fans,

1500
01:09:40,967 --> 01:09:44,955
It was like, oh my God, I feel like something I never felt before.

1501
01:09:45,175 --> 01:09:47,300
Even nowadays, playing big games, I never...

1502
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:48,182
I'm not feeling that.

1503
01:09:48,202 --> 01:09:48,463
What was it?

1504
01:09:48,523 --> 01:09:48,804
Nerves?

1505
01:09:49,225 --> 01:09:50,088
Anxiety?

1506
01:09:50,188 --> 01:09:50,510
Energy?

1507
01:09:50,891 --> 01:09:51,352
Not as...

1508
01:09:51,713 --> 01:09:57,587
You know when you're nervous in a game, you want to go to the toilet maybe, or maybe you go buy flights, you know that?

1509
01:09:58,228 --> 01:10:02,772
feeling in this one which is a heat inside your body like burning inside weird

1510
01:10:03,433 --> 01:10:08,173
that's honestly I knew I was looking forward to it we were looking forward to it but how good was that

1511
01:10:08,675 --> 01:10:09,036
The best.

1512
01:10:09,257 --> 01:10:09,698
The best.

1513
01:10:09,918 --> 01:10:10,881
Emi, you're the man.

1514
01:10:10,981 --> 01:10:12,124
Kurt, you're not bad either.

1515
01:10:13,266 --> 01:10:14,128
It's been The False Cast.

1516
01:10:14,189 --> 01:10:14,870
I hope you enjoyed it.

1517
01:10:14,890 --> 01:10:15,412
We'll see you soon.
