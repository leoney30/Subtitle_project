1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:06,224
But sometimes you can do, oh, my God, I need to save it, or if I save it, or the fans, or... And it goes through your mind, you know?

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:07,052
That's my question.

3
00:00:07,072 --> 00:00:09,080
How do you deal with these thoughts?

4
00:00:09,762 --> 00:00:12,211
The moment of the strike is when I say, OK,

5
00:00:12,532 --> 00:00:13,233
This is my moment.

6
00:00:13,934 --> 00:00:15,295
I need to focus only on myself.

7
00:00:18,805 --> 00:00:19,347
Brilliant.

8
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:27,964
Oh, chilly, mate.

9
00:00:27,984 --> 00:00:28,968
It's really, really cold.

10
00:00:34,588 --> 00:00:37,766
It's been 12 years in this country and too freezing for me.

11
00:00:38,257 --> 00:00:41,871
I've got a little break between games so I'm going to work a little bit on penalties

12
00:00:42,715 --> 00:00:48,572
and mental side it's good to always you know when you when you're successful winning tournaments big tournaments

13
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:51,365
So it's good to keep trying and improve yourself.

14
00:00:51,764 --> 00:00:52,786
It's a big moment for me.

15
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:56,615
I always feel like it's an opportunity to

16
00:00:57,257 --> 00:01:01,450
to shine and to show how good I am, how strong I am in penalties.

17
00:01:02,165 --> 00:01:03,447
I never think I'm gonna be the hero.

18
00:01:03,527 --> 00:01:06,672
It's just about, you know, enjoying the moment.

19
00:01:07,182 --> 00:01:08,185
since a very young age.

20
00:01:08,466 --> 00:01:12,397
Since I remember, probably seven, eight, I've always been lucky in penalty shootouts, you know.

21
00:01:13,414 --> 00:01:14,116
win more than lose.

22
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:16,586
When you're young, you just play for joy.

23
00:01:16,867 --> 00:01:17,791
You know, when you're older,

24
00:01:18,413 --> 00:01:22,288
You play for a team, you play for a club, so you need to perform in a different way.

25
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:28,006
It's hard to go to every goalie's mind, but sometimes goalies, when you go to a penalty shootout,

26
00:01:28,286 --> 00:01:34,132
they can have a little bit of pressure on themselves, thinking, oh, if you don't take one, then everyone will look at me and...

27
00:01:34,926 --> 00:01:38,202
and they would think I had a bad game or I'm not good enough.

28
00:01:39,175 --> 00:01:39,897
Yeah, good to hear.

29
00:01:40,018 --> 00:01:40,700
Emi or Djibouti?

30
00:01:40,961 --> 00:01:41,803
Emi, Emi is fine.

31
00:01:41,864 --> 00:01:42,847
Yeah, Europe or Mami.

32
00:01:43,652 --> 00:01:45,658
If you come over here, let me explain it to you real quick.

33
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:47,182
This is your brain activity right here.

34
00:01:47,684 --> 00:01:52,181
and then we see the different brain states and what we are trying to help you with is to better get into the zone.

35
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:55,927
So when you're in that optimal brain state, then the sound will play from the speaker, this one right here,

36
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:59,629
And this will indicate how well you're managing pressure and how well focused you are right now.

37
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,038
So Emi, can you go through your routine and just explain a little bit what you would do in the game, please?

38
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:07,547
I move side to side.

39
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,041
It's just a bit for me to get that fire up.

40
00:02:10,382 --> 00:02:14,125
Sometimes quicker, sometimes slower, depends how I feel during the day.

41
00:02:14,345 --> 00:02:16,087
And then when it's about to strike,

42
00:02:16,707 --> 00:02:19,852
is when you think, OK, I don't want to go early, because they wait for you.

43
00:02:19,912 --> 00:02:20,733
They're still looking at you.

44
00:02:20,813 --> 00:02:22,516
They're very clever nowadays, so it's about

45
00:02:23,257 --> 00:02:27,970
moving a little bit to not show them any sign of which way I'm going.

46
00:02:28,692 --> 00:02:35,228
and then fire at the last minute, you know, because if I'm going there, by the moment he's about to strike, he sees me, so they would put it that way.

47
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,944
Make sure I don't open my legs too wide to be ready to push.

48
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:42,039
First, we're going to do penalties towards this side.

49
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,042
Five to this.

50
00:02:43,783 --> 00:02:45,267
Then we'll do five either direction.

51
00:02:45,447 --> 00:02:46,109
You don't know which side.

52
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,134
And then we do five random.

53
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,291
Remember the sound?

54
00:02:50,451 --> 00:02:50,872
Yeah.

55
00:02:50,932 --> 00:02:51,613
OK, so it's this mode.

56
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:54,338
When I say focus, that's when you focus and you get clear.

57
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:55,319
You know what I mean?

58
00:02:55,881 --> 00:02:57,144
So we start with the first five.

59
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:57,585
Focus.

60
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:01,795
Okay, good.

61
00:03:02,076 --> 00:03:02,296
Nice.

62
00:03:04,742 --> 00:03:05,363
Nice, good.

63
00:03:10,282 --> 00:03:11,004
All right, three more.

64
00:03:12,007 --> 00:03:12,348
Focus.

65
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:16,901
Nice, great.

66
00:03:17,704 --> 00:03:18,226
Nice.

67
00:03:21,517 --> 00:03:25,645
When you have this fluid motion that you had, for example, at the World Cup, it was really fluid.

68
00:03:25,665 --> 00:03:26,567
The timing was perfect.

69
00:03:27,529 --> 00:03:29,337
That's when you make, say, timing.

70
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,321
Timing.

71
00:03:30,482 --> 00:03:30,803
Timing.

72
00:03:30,964 --> 00:03:32,688
You have the pressure of getting there, right?

73
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:36,938
Because if you're basically here with the hand, it's a higher chance of you saving it, right?

74
00:03:37,399 --> 00:03:41,745
So that's why you really extend negative pressure as something that can limit you.

75
00:03:42,185 --> 00:03:43,088
to perform at your best.

76
00:03:43,268 --> 00:03:46,598
So it can also limit you from jumping as far if your movement is not fluid.

77
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:53,324
So that's why you want to really be optimally focused to get to the furthest distance and have the highest percentage of saving a penalty.

78
00:03:53,837 --> 00:03:56,381
And it's that confidence that makes you deal with that pressure.

79
00:03:56,542 --> 00:03:59,888
If you're not sure where you're going to go and you change your mind during the run,

80
00:04:01,505 --> 00:04:01,886
That's it.

81
00:04:02,027 --> 00:04:02,568
You don't say that.

82
00:04:02,608 --> 00:04:04,293
Some of the goalies, you know when he's running.

83
00:04:04,895 --> 00:04:07,340
They keep changing, oh, West is going low, high, mid.

84
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:08,622
I'm choosing one side.

85
00:04:08,943 --> 00:04:10,667
I'm not thinking he's going mid, low.

86
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:13,212
until I think it is going right.

87
00:04:13,413 --> 00:04:15,678
And I mean, that's part of dealing with the pressure is the preparation, right?

88
00:04:15,698 --> 00:04:18,204
Yeah, but the preparation in the World Cup, in the final,

89
00:04:19,446 --> 00:04:22,073
Messi told me that he was going legs high.

90
00:04:22,574 --> 00:04:23,657
So I prepared myself.

91
00:04:24,517 --> 00:04:25,879
The body shape, yeah, it's going there.

92
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,164
But then I dive right, the height, and the ball went low.

93
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:33,391
So my preparation was to go high, then in the moment,

94
00:04:33,912 --> 00:04:38,583
went low, so I'm more about my intuition as well.

95
00:04:38,723 --> 00:04:40,447
I know it's true about the stats.

96
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:43,056
Just read what's in front of you at the moment.

97
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:48,665
Oh.

98
00:04:55,064 --> 00:04:55,639
Good strike still.

99
00:04:57,662 --> 00:05:04,314
When, for example, you're going to shoot out, let's say, the first four score, and the pressure comes for the fifth, how do you deal with that?

100
00:05:04,795 --> 00:05:07,369
The first thing you need to believe in yourself, you know?

101
00:05:07,762 --> 00:05:12,594
No more distracting them or trying to go into their head.

102
00:05:12,614 --> 00:05:13,998
I think more about

103
00:05:14,499 --> 00:05:16,103
my timing, you know, my footwork.

104
00:05:16,605 --> 00:05:18,450
Let's say, if you guessed the side,

105
00:05:19,557 --> 00:05:21,511
then you don't save it, then it's off.

106
00:05:22,295 --> 00:05:26,564
You know, you get upset, but you're doing something good, which is guessing the site.

107
00:05:26,925 --> 00:05:28,007
And then the problem is when

108
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:29,555
It's a penalty shootout.

109
00:05:31,184 --> 00:05:35,070
and you go nowhere near, you think, oh, it's not my day, you know?

110
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,053
But I always think, I always say one.

111
00:05:37,947 --> 00:05:39,553
You know, I could have saved two easily.

112
00:05:39,854 --> 00:05:42,002
You know, in five, you save two, you win.

113
00:05:42,805 --> 00:05:43,909
I've got less chances, you know.

114
00:05:43,929 --> 00:05:43,969
Oh!

115
00:05:48,444 --> 00:05:50,087
Your body shape since you go in there, 100%.

116
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,487
You do?

117
00:05:50,507 --> 00:05:50,628
Yeah.

118
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,457
Can you specify that a little bit?

119
00:05:54,497 --> 00:05:57,124
His body shape, his hand is stuck to his body.

120
00:05:57,284 --> 00:06:00,010
You know, when he's going across, he leaves his thumb a little bit more.

121
00:06:00,631 --> 00:06:01,874
But this one, he kept the hands.

122
00:06:02,455 --> 00:06:04,261
close to him, so I knew he was going that way.

123
00:06:12,028 --> 00:06:12,491
Brilliant.

124
00:06:12,792 --> 00:06:14,461
Your focus was very, very clear.

125
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:16,491
And that's why I even noticed it in your eyes.

126
00:06:16,872 --> 00:06:18,075
In your eyes, now you're excited.

127
00:06:18,115 --> 00:06:19,098
Now it's the part that you love.

128
00:06:19,358 --> 00:06:20,261
All right, last one, last one.

129
00:06:20,281 --> 00:06:20,622
Let's go.

130
00:06:21,223 --> 00:06:21,684
Focus.

131
00:06:23,844 --> 00:06:24,954
He's done something different now.

132
00:06:26,087 --> 00:06:28,251
Because he doesn't want to show me the body shape.

133
00:06:28,612 --> 00:06:29,274
You see, no?

134
00:06:29,955 --> 00:06:30,736
He's getting to you.

135
00:06:30,777 --> 00:06:31,398
You do your thing.

136
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:32,821
It's going hard.

137
00:06:36,762 --> 00:06:37,946
Did you see?

138
00:06:38,086 --> 00:06:38,728
Dirty.

139
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:41,939
We're going to look into the data now.

140
00:06:42,827 --> 00:06:44,554
First of all, you need a proper challenge.

141
00:06:45,598 --> 00:06:47,465
For you, it's like, if you're under-activated,

142
00:06:48,018 --> 00:06:48,941
There's no point to do it.

143
00:06:48,961 --> 00:06:49,663
Yeah, it's normal.

144
00:06:49,723 --> 00:06:50,665
Was that always like that?

145
00:06:51,046 --> 00:06:51,848
That's my question to you.

146
00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:54,436
Were you like, because it's a character thing, it's a personality answer, right?

147
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:54,556
Yeah.

148
00:06:54,696 --> 00:06:56,341
No, no, I need to challenge, yeah.

149
00:06:56,421 --> 00:06:59,871
I need someone to wind you up, to fire you up, to give you feel.

150
00:07:00,165 --> 00:07:02,332
Because the one thing I find really interesting, you're 85% more in the zone

151
00:07:04,961 --> 00:07:07,470
when it goes anywhere compared to left or right.

152
00:07:08,098 --> 00:07:10,681
When the challenge is really high, you're actually more in the zone.

153
00:07:10,842 --> 00:07:13,525
And I find that actually quite fascinating, you know, because it really represents

154
00:07:14,266 --> 00:07:16,493
personality and the way you act and this kind of stuff.

155
00:07:16,774 --> 00:07:18,500
Yeah, it makes me more comfortable.

156
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,864
Yeah, it makes me more comfortable.

157
00:07:19,884 --> 00:07:20,325
It does, yeah.

158
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:24,693
I play to be fired up and to lose all my nerves.

159
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:31,114
But sometimes you can do, oh, my God, I need to save it, or if I save it, or the fans, or... And it goes through your mind, you know?

160
00:07:31,454 --> 00:07:33,979
Ask my question, how do you deal with these thoughts?

161
00:07:34,641 --> 00:07:38,088
The moment of the strike is when I say, OK, this is my moment.

162
00:07:38,832 --> 00:07:40,681
I need to focus only on myself, you know?

163
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:42,544
Okay, so in that moment it's like switch off.

164
00:07:42,584 --> 00:07:46,692
Switch off and it's me against the ball against him, not against, you know.

165
00:07:47,714 --> 00:07:50,059
3 billion people watching on the TV in the World Cup finals.

166
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:51,061
It's as simple as that.

167
00:07:51,441 --> 00:07:52,544
You know, I used to say,

168
00:07:53,466 --> 00:07:56,924
message to shoot penalty to to get that confidence and i can't save anything

169
00:07:57,306 --> 00:07:58,271
So it doesn't help.

170
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,458
It doesn't help.

171
00:08:01,388 --> 00:08:05,826
for your confidence for me so i know not practically too much okay i got it all right

172
00:08:06,468 --> 00:08:07,553
Thank you so much, appreciate it.

173
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:09,000
It was a pleasure.

174
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,426
Well, one thing we found was that

175
00:08:11,109 --> 00:08:12,052
He really needs the challenge.

176
00:08:12,393 --> 00:08:15,842
So with that, he increases actually with the focus.

177
00:08:15,942 --> 00:08:16,885
It's quite fascinating.

178
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:22,533
I got 85% I think when I'm more in the zone and the pressure is there and I focus more

179
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:26,459
when the pressure's on, which is interesting, you know, and that's something that

180
00:08:27,455 --> 00:08:31,049
that I do, you know, in the pressure zone is when I play the best.

181
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:37,464
When you're a young goalkeeper, you listen to what the club says and you try to do everything for the club.

182
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:41,238
but sometimes you need to listen to yourself and just follow your gut.

183
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,243
and take risks.

184
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,816
If you don't take the risk, you won't have big rewards.

185
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:50,503
You have to put in your hard work, your technique, your mental preparation, all these kinds of things, and then you just give it your best shot.

186
00:08:50,804 --> 00:08:52,227
And if all those things come together,

187
00:08:52,227 --> 00:08:52,969
That's like a puzzle.

188
00:08:53,531 --> 00:08:53,912
Focus.

189
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:58,828
When there's that amount of pressure, I really enjoy it because I always think it's a game.

190
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:02,079
At the end of the day, it's just football, so you can win or lose.

191
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,087
But it's always good to have fun.

192
00:09:05,396 --> 00:09:05,677
Thank you.
