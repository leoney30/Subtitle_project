1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
But sometimes you can go, “Oh my god, I need to save.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,840
If I save, the other fans”. All of that, and it goes through your mind.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,640
That’s my question, how do you deal with these thoughts? 

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,200
The moment of the strike is when I say, okay, this is my moment.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,280
I need to focus only on myself.

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,200
Brilliant!

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,800
Oh, chilly mate. Really, really cold.

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,880
Been 12 years in this country and still freezing for me.

9
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,240
I got a little break between games, so I'm going to work a little bit

10
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,360
on penalties and on the mental side.

11
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,720
It's good to always, you know, when you're successful,

12
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,520
winning tournaments, big tournaments,

13
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,680
it's so good to keep trying and improve yourself.

14
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,000
It's a big moment for me. I always feel like

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,200
it's an opportunity to shine and to show how good I am,

16
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,880
how strong I am in penalties.

17
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,600
I never think I'm going to be the hero.

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,880
It's just about enjoying the moment.

19
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,400
Since a very young age,

20
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,200
since I remember probably seven, eight,

21
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,960
I’ve always been lucky in penalty shootouts you know.

22
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,360
I win more than lose.

23
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,720
When you're young, you just play for joy.

24
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,200
When you're older, you play for a team, you play for a club,

25
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,400
so you need to perform in a different way.

26
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,400
It's hard to go to every goalie's mind,

27
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,040
but sometimes goalies, when you go to a penalty shootout,

28
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,160
they can have a little bit of pressure on themselves thinking, 

29
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,600
oh, if you haven’t saved one, then everyone will look on me

30
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,280
and they would think I had a bad game or I'm not good enough.

31
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,080
How you doing? You good?

32
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,880
Yeah. Good. You?

33
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,760
Emi or Dibu?

34
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,560
Emi is fine.

35
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,480
Yeah, in Europe I'm Emi.

36
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,600
If you come over here, let me explain it to you real quick.

37
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,560
This is your brain activity right here.

38
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,680
And then we see the different brain states and what we are trying

39
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,200
to help you with is to better get into the zone.

40
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,720
So when you’re in that optimal brain state,

41
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,440
then the sound will play on the speaker, this one right here

42
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,320
and this will indicate how well you’re managing pressure

43
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,880
and how well focussed you are right now.

44
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,160
So Emi can you go through your routine

45
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,360
and just explain a little bit what you do in a game please?

46
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,240
I move side to side. It’s just for me to get that fire up.

47
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,320
Sometimes move quicker, sometimes move slower, 

48
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,200
depends how I feel during the day.

49
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,480
And then when it's about to strike is when you think, okay,

50
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,880
I don't want to go early 'cause they wait for you.

51
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,960
They're still looking at you. They're very clever nowadays.

52
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,240
So it's about moving a little bit

53
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,600
to not show them any sign of which way I'm going

54
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,440
and then fire at the last minute.

55
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,240
Because if I'm going there, by the moment he's about to strike,

56
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,720
he sees me, so they would put it that way.

57
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,200
Make sure I don’t open my legs too wide to be ready to push.

58
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,280
First we're going to do penalties towards this side.

59
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,640
Five to this.

60
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,520
Then we’ll do five either direction, you don't know which side.

61
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,880
And then we do five random.

62
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,480
Remember the sound.

63
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,040
Yeah. 

64
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,440
So it's this moment. When I say focus, that's when you focus and get clear.

65
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,760
You know what I mean?

66
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,200
So we start with the first five.

67
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,880
Focus!

68
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,240
Okay, good. Nice.

69
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,840
Nice. Good.

70
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,840
Alright, three more.

71
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,920
Focus.

72
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,120
Nice. Great.

73
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,960
When you have this fluid motion that you had,

74
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,960
for example at the World Cup.

75
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,760
It was really fluid, the timing was perfect,

76
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,160
when it touched his foot.

77
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,440
That's when you make a save, timing.

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,920
Timing.

79
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,920
You have the pressure of getting there, right?

80
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,440
Because if you are basically here with the hand,

81
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,320
it's a higher chance of you saving it, right?

82
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,680
So that's why you really extend.

83
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,000
Negative pressure is something that can limit you to perform at your best.

84
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So it can also limit you from jumping as far, if your movement is not fluid.

85
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,240
So that's why you want to really be optimally focused

86
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,600
to get to the furthest distance

87
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,720
and have the highest percentage of saving a penalty.

88
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,280
And it's that confidence that makes you deal with that pressure, right?

89
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,200
If you're not sure where's it's going to go

90
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,120
and you change your mind during the run,

91
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,480
that's it. You don't save it.

92
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,560
Some of the goalies when he's running, they keep changing

93
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,520
where he's going low, high, mid.

94
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,760
I'm choosing one side.

95
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,960
I'm not thinking he's going mid, low, high.

96
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,240
I'm just thinking it's going right.

97
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,560
And that's part of dealing with the pressure is the preparation, right?

98
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,160
 Yeah but the preparation in the World Cup, in the final,

99
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,320
Messi told me that he was going, he likes high

100
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,840
So I prepared myself the body shape, yeah, he's going there.

101
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,600
But then I dive right, high, but the ball went low,

102
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,000
so my preparation

103
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,600
was to go high, then in the moment went low.

104
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,920
So I'm more about my intuition as well.

105
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,760
Not just about the stats.

106
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,160
Just read what's in front of you in the moment.

107
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,520
Nice.

108
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,920
Ok.

109
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,480
Good strikes though.

110
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,760
When, for example, you go in a shootout,

111
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,360
let's say the first four score and the pressure comes for the fifth,

112
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,200
how do you deal with that situation?

113
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,760
The first thing you need to believe in yourself.

114
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,520
None of this distracting them or try to go into their head.

115
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,440
I think more about my timing. My footwork.

116
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,360
Let's say if you guess the side,

117
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,200
then you don't save it, then it’s ah

118
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,480
you get upset but you're doing something good, 

119
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,800
which is guessing the side.

120
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,040
Then the problem is when it's a penalty shootout

121
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
and you go nowhere near,

122
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,080
I think oof, “it's not my day.”

123
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,280
But I always think, I always save one.

124
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,640
I could have saved two easily.

125
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,440
In five, you save two, you win.

126
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,400
I’ve got less chances. I'm always against the odds here.

127
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,560
Your body shape says you’re going there, 100%. Yeah!

128
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,800
Can you specify that a little bit?

129
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,280
His body shape, his hand is stuck to his body.

130
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,560
When he's going across, he leaves his arm a little bit more.

131
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,080
But this one, he kept the hands close to him

132
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,720
so I knew he was going that way.

133
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,640
Brilliant!

134
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,720
Your focus was very very clear.

135
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,760
And that's where I even noticed it in your eyes.

136
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,320
In your eyes now you're excited. Now it's the part that you love.

137
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,720
Alright, last one, last one. Let's go. Focus!

138
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,480
He's done something different now.

139
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,280
because he doesn't want to show me the body shape, you see, no?

140
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,400
He’s getting to you. Huh? You do your thing.

141
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,800
He’s going hard.

142
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,240
Ohhh!

143
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,240
You see, nearly missed!

144
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,400
Good job.

145
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
Okay, we're going to look into the data now.

146
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,160
First of all, you need a proper challenge.

147
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,640
Yeah.

148
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,920
For you, it's like if you're underactivated...

149
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,680
There's no point to do it. Yeah, it's normal. 

150
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,960
Was that always like that? That's my question to you.

151
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,360
Were you like because it's a character thing,

152
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,880
it’s your personality also, right?

153
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,600
No, I need a challenge. Yeah.

154
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,160
I need someone to wind you up and to fire you up.

155
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,120
To give you fuel.

156
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,720
Because the one thing that I found was really interesting,

157
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,480
you're 85% more in the zone when it goes anywhere

158
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,800
compared to left or right.

159
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,640
When the challenge is really high, you're actually more in the zone.

160
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,560
And I find that actually quite fascinating because it really represents

161
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,960
your personality and the way you act and this kind of stuff.

162
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,080
That’s interesting, right?

163
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,200
Yeah. It makes you more comfortable.

164
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,120
It makes you more comfortable.

165
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,760
It does yeah.

166
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,240
It does yeah.

167
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,880
I play to be fired up and to lose all my nerves.

168
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,440
But sometimes you can go, “Oh my god, I need to save.

169
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,800
If I save, the other fans”. all of that, and it goes through your mind.

170
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,600
That’s my question, how do you deal with these thoughts? 

171
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,960
The moment of the strike is when I say

172
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,360
okay, this is my moment.

173
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,040
I need to focus only on myself.

174
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,600
Ok so in that moment it's like switch off?

175
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,400
Switch off and it's me against the ball against him.

176
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,960
Not against three billion people watching on the TV in a World Cup final.

177
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,360
As simple as that.

178
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,080
You know I used to say to Messi to shoot

179
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,760
penalty to you to get that confidence

180
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,840
and I can't save anything, so it doesn't help.

181
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,600
It doesn't help.

182
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,160
It’s actually bad for your confidence!

183
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,600
It’s actually bad for me, so I'm not practicing too much.

184
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,520
Thank you so much. Appreciate it.

185
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,920
Thank you, brothers. It was a pleasure.

186
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,120
Well, one thing we found was that he really needs the challenge.

187
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,960
So with that, he increases actually with the focus. It's quite fascinating.

188
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,680
I got 85% I think when I'm more in the zone

189
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,600
and the pressure is there

190
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,400
and I focus more when the pressure's on, which is interesting.

191
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,000
And that's something that I do.

192
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,040
When the pressure is on, is when I play the best. So it's good.

193
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,480
You know when you're a young goalkeeper, you listen to what the club says

194
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,720
and you try to do everything for the club,

195
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,120
but sometimes you need to listen to yourself

196
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,440
and just follow your gut and take risks.

197
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,200
If you don't take the risk, you won't have big rewards.

198
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,480
You have to put in your hard work,

199
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,840
your technique, your mental preparation, all these kinds of things,

200
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,560
and then you just give it your best shot.

201
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,080
And if all those things come together, it's like a puzzle.

202
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,360
Focus!

203
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,360
When it’s that amount of pressure, I really enjoy it

204
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,760
because I always think it's a game.

205
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,200
At the end of the day, it’s just football, so you can win or lose.

206
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,200
But it’s always good to have fun.
